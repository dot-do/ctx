## Example Interaction

**Customer**: My API key isn't working.

**Agent**: I'd be happy to help you with your API key issue. Let me check a few things:

1. Can you confirm you're using the key in the correct environment (production vs development)?
2. Are you seeing a specific error message?

In the meantime, I can generate a new API key for you if needed. Would that be helpful?

## Metrics

- **Resolution Rate**: % of issues resolved without human escalation
- **Response Time**: Average time to first response
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Rating from post-interaction surveys
- **Escalation Rate**: % of conversations escalated to humans
