# Test Brand

This is a test brand definition created to verify that the GitHub webhook integration is working correctly with the repo.do GitHub App.

## Purpose

When this file is committed and pushed, the webhook should trigger and sync this brand definition to the PostgreSQL database in the `things` table with:
- `ns: 'brand'`
- `id: 'test-brand'`
- `type: 'Brand'`
- `content: [markdown content]`
- `data: [frontmatter JSON]`

## Verification

To verify the webhook worked:
1. Check GitHub App webhook delivery logs
2. Query the database: `SELECT * FROM things WHERE ns = 'brand' AND id = 'test-brand'`
3. Check API logs for any errors
