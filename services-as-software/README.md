# Services-as-Software

Define services that AI can deliver scalably - services that traditionally required human labor.

## Overview

**Services-as-Software** transforms human-delivered services into software-deliverable services using AI agents, code, and hybrid automation. Map services to **ONET occupations** (skill requirements) and **GDPval tasks** (economic value).

## Core Concept

### Traditional Service Delivery

```
Customer Request
  â†“
Human Worker (hours/days)
  â†“
Manual Delivery
  â†“
Variable Quality
  â†“
Limited Scale
```

### Services-as-Software

```
Customer Request (API/Web)
  â†“
AI Agent (minutes)
  â†“
Automated Delivery
  â†“
Consistent Quality
  â†“
Infinite Scale
```

## Integration Points

**ONET (Occupational Information Network):**
- 1,016 occupations with structured data
- 19,000+ task statements
- Knowledge, Skills, Abilities (KSA) taxonomy
- Map services to occupations for skill requirements

**GDPval (Economic Value Measurement):**
- 1,320 real-world tasks across 44 occupations
- Economic value per task
- Automation potential scoring
- GDP contribution tracking

**.do Platform:**
- Functions: Execute service tasks (code/generative/human/agentic)
- Agents: Autonomous workers for complex services
- Workflows: Multi-step service orchestration
- Marketplace: Services.Delivery for discovery and transactions

        â†’ Fully Managed (Human-led)
```

## Pricing Models

### Fixed Price
Best for standardized services with predictable effort.

```mdx
pricing:
  model: fixed
  basePrice: 99
  currency: USD
```

### Per-Unit
Best for scalable services with variable volume.

```mdx
pricing:
  model: per-unit
  basePrice: 0.10  # per field/item/transaction
  currency: USD
```

### Subscription
Best for ongoing services with continuous value.

```mdx
pricing:
  model: subscription
  basePrice: 499
  currency: USD
  billingCycle: monthly
```

### Tiered
Best for services with multiple complexity levels.

```mdx
pricing:
  model: tiered
  tiers:
    - name: Simple
      price: 49
      features: [...]
    - name: Standard
      price: 99
    - name: Complex
      price: 199
```

### Value-Based
Best for services with measurable ROI.

```mdx
pricing:
  model: value-based
  percentage: 15  # % of value created
  cap: 10000
  floor: 500
```

## Quality Standards

### Accuracy

Define measurable quality targets:

```mdx
quality:
  - name: Accuracy Rate
    target: 99.5
    minimum: 99.0
    unit: percent
    measurement: automated-validation
```

### SLAs

Guarantee service levels:

```mdx
sla:
  uptime: 99.9
  responseTime:
    p95: 200  # milliseconds
    p99: 500
  support:
    critical: 15 minutes
    high: 2 hours
    normal: 24 hours
```

### Remediation

Define what happens when quality isn't met:

```mdx
remedies:
  - violation: "Accuracy < 99%"
    remedy: "Full refund + free re-work"
  - violation: "Late delivery (>24h)"
    remedy: "50% discount"
```
