# Services-as-Software Type System

TypeScript interfaces for defining AI-delivered services based on ONET occupational data. Services are work previously performed by humans, now deliverable by AI agents.

## Overview

**Services-as-Software** enables AI agents to deliver professional services with guaranteed quality, turnaround times, and pricing. Each service maps to ONET occupational tasks and is validated against real-world performance data.

## Core Concept

A **Service** is:
- Work previously requiring human expertise
- Now deliverable by AI agents
- With guaranteed outcomes and SLAs
- Priced transparently and competitively

## Service Lifecycle

```
Draft → Active → Order → Fulfillment → Delivery → Review
```

### 1. Draft
Define service parameters:
- ONET occupation mapping
- Quality specifications
- Pricing model
- Fulfillment workflow
- Agent assignments

### 2. Active
Service available for orders:
- Listed in marketplace
- Agents ready
- Capacity allocated
- SLAs published

### 3. Order
Customer submits request:
- Provides brief
- Uploads files
- Accepts terms
- Makes payment

### 4. Fulfillment
AI agents execute:
- Workflow triggered
- Steps executed
- Quality checks
- Human escalation if needed

### 5. Delivery
Customer receives:
- Deliverables
- Documentation
- Usage rights
- Support access

### 6. Review
Feedback collected:
- Satisfaction rating
- Quality metrics
- Improvement suggestions
- Service refinement

## ONET Integration

Every service maps to ONET occupational data:

```yaml
service:
  occupation: "15-1252.00"  # Software Developers
  occupationTitle: "Software Developers"
  tasks:
    - "15-1252.00.001"  # Analyze user needs
    - "15-1252.00.002"  # Design software
  skills:
    - "Programming"
    - "Systems Analysis"
  knowledge:
    - "Computers and Electronics"
    - "Engineering and Technology"
```

## Quality Assurance

Multi-layered quality:

1. **Automated Testing** - Code quality, format compliance
2. **AI Review** - Semantic analysis, completeness
3. **Human Review** - Final quality check (if needed)
4. **Customer Acceptance** - Satisfaction guarantee

## Pricing Models

### Fixed Price
```yaml
pricing:
  type: fixed
  basePrice: 500
  currency: USD
  billingCycle: one-time
```

### Hourly Rate
```yaml
pricing:
  type: hourly
  basePrice: 75
  currency: USD
  billingCycle: hourly
  minimumHours: 4
```

### Subscription
```yaml
pricing:
  type: subscription
  basePrice: 1999
  currency: USD
  billingCycle: monthly
  tiers:
    - name: "Basic"
      price: 1999
      features: ["10 requests/month", "48h turnaround"]
    - name: "Pro"
      price: 4999
      features: ["50 requests/month", "24h turnaround"]
```

### Usage-Based
```yaml
pricing:
  type: usage
  basePrice: 0
  currency: USD
  usage:
    metric: "words"
    pricePerUnit: 0.01
    includedUnits: 10000
```

## Service Capacity

Define throughput limits:

```yaml
capacity:
  concurrent: 10  # Parallel executions
  daily: 50       # Per day
  weekly: 300     # Per week
  monthly: 1200   # Per month
  scaleThreshold: 0.8  # Scale at 80% capacity
```

## Fulfillment Workflow

Automated execution pipeline:

```yaml
fulfillmentWorkflow:
  id: "workflow/content-writing"
  steps:
    - id: "analyze-brief"
      type: automated
      assignee: "agent/analyzer"
      duration: { min: 5, max: 15, unit: minutes }

    - id: "generate-content"
      type: automated
      assignee: "agent/writer"
      duration: { min: 30, max: 120, unit: minutes }

    - id: "quality-review"
      type: automated
      assignee: "agent/reviewer"
      duration: { min: 10, max: 30, unit: minutes }

    - id: "human-review"
      type: manual
      assignee: "human/editor"
      duration: { min: 15, max: 60, unit: minutes }
      condition: "quality_score < 0.9"

    - id: "deliver"
      type: automated
      assignee: "agent/delivery"
      duration: { min: 1, max: 5, unit: minutes }
```

## Agent Assignment

Assign AI agents to services:

```yaml
assignedAgents:
  - id: "agent/content-writer"
    name: "ContentWriter"
    type: "specialized"
    capabilities: ["writing", "editing", "SEO"]
    model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"

  - id: "agent/quality-reviewer"
    name: "QualityReviewer"
    type: "specialized"
    capabilities: ["review", "scoring", "feedback"]
    model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
```

## Human Backup

Human escalation for complex cases:

```yaml
backupHumans:
  - id: "human/senior-editor"
    name: "Senior Editor"
    role: "editor"
    skills: ["editing", "publishing", "mentoring"]
    availability: "business-hours"
```

## SLA Guarantees

Service level agreements:

```yaml
sla:
  availability: 0.99  # 99% uptime
  responseTime:
    typical: 30
    unit: minutes
  resolutionTime:
    typical: 24
    unit: hours
  qualityTarget: 0.95  # 95% satisfaction
  penaltyTerms: "Full refund if SLA breach"
```
