# Chapter 6: Launching - Go-to-Market at AI Speed

In September 2024, a solo founder launched a SaaS product called **Zenkit**‚Äîa project management tool for creative teams. Within 24 hours, Zenkit had:
- 1,247 website visitors
- 89 trial signups
- 12 paying customers
- $468 in revenue

The founder didn't run paid ads. Didn't have an email list. Didn't have a social media following.

Instead, AI agents:
- Identified 47 relevant online communities (Reddit, Discord, Slack)
- Generated tailored launch posts for each community
- Posted to Product Hunt, Hacker News, Indie Hackers simultaneously
- Responded to comments and questions in real-time
- Optimized messaging based on conversion data

Total human time invested in launch: **3 hours** (primarily strategic decisions about positioning and pricing).

This is the new reality of go-to-market in the Business-as-Code era: **AI agents can execute comprehensive launch campaigns‚Äîat scale, across dozens of channels‚Äîfaster than humans can draft a single tweet.**

But here's what most people miss: **The real advantage isn't speed. It's systematic testing at scale.** AI agents don't guess which message will resonate, which channels will convert, or which pricing will maximize revenue. They **test everything**, learn from data, and optimize in real-time.

In this chapter, we'll explore how Business-as-Code transforms launching from an art (dependent on founder intuition and luck) into a science (driven by data and systematic experimentation).

---

## The Traditional Launch Playbook

Let's start by examining what we're replacing.

**Traditional Path: Build ‚Üí Beta ‚Üí Launch ‚Üí Iterate**

### Phase 1: Pre-Launch (4-8 weeks)

**Positioning & Messaging**:
- Founder writes copy for homepage, landing pages
- Designer creates brand assets (logo, colors, visual identity)
- Copywriter refines messaging based on target audience
- A/B tests different value propositions (manually, slowly)

**Content Creation**:
- Write blog posts explaining product (2-4 posts)
- Create demo videos (1-2 videos)
- Design social media graphics (10-20 assets)
- Write email campaigns (5-10 emails)

**Distribution Prep**:
- Build email list via landing page (target: 1,000-5,000 subscribers)
- Identify launch channels (Product Hunt, Hacker News, Twitter)
- Reach out to journalists and influencers for coverage
- Prepare press kit and outreach emails

**Total Time**: 100-200 hours of founder/team time

**Total Cost**: $5,000-$20,000 (design, copywriting, video production)

### Phase 2: Launch Day (1 day)

- Post to Product Hunt (hope for #1 Product of the Day)
- Post to Hacker News (hope it reaches front page)
- Share on social media (limited by follower count)
- Send email to subscribers (if list exists)
- Respond to comments and questions (manually, frantically)

**Results (Typical)**:
- 500-5,000 visitors (depending on traction)
- 50-200 trial signups (1-4% conversion)
- 2-10 paying customers (2-5% trial-to-paid)
- Spike in traffic, then rapid decline

### Phase 3: Post-Launch Iteration (Ongoing)

- Monitor analytics to understand drop-off points
- Manually A/B test different messaging
- Adjust pricing based on customer feedback
- Try different channels (Reddit, LinkedIn, Twitter Ads)
- Iterate on content and outreach

**Total Time to Product-Market Fit**: 6-18 months (if achieved at all)

**Success Rate**: According to CB Insights, **42% of startups fail due to "no market need"**‚Äîoften because the launch never gained traction or the founder couldn't iterate fast enough to find fit.

This process is slow, expensive, and relies heavily on founder intuition and luck. Most founders launch once, see mediocre results, and don't have the resources (time, money, mental energy) to iterate systematically.

**There has to be a better way.**

---

## AI-Powered Go-to-Market

Business-as-Code enables a fundamentally different launch strategy: **systematic, multi-channel, real-time optimization.**

Instead of one founder guessing which message and channel will work, AI agents test dozens of variations simultaneously across dozens of channels‚Äîand learn from every interaction.

### Step 1: Market Research & Positioning

Before launching, AI agents conduct comprehensive market research to inform positioning.

**Competitive Analysis**:

```yaml
market_research:
  product: "Zenkit - Project Management for Creative Teams"

  competitors_identified: 47
  top_competitors:
    - name: "Asana"
      positioning: "Work management for all teams"
      pricing: "$10.99-$24.99 per user/month"
      strengths: ["Established brand", "Enterprise features"]
      weaknesses: ["Complex for small teams", "Expensive"]

    - name: "Monday.com"
      positioning: "Work OS for any team"
      pricing: "$8-$16 per user/month"
      strengths: ["Visual interface", "Customizable"]
      weaknesses: ["Overwhelming for simple projects"]

    - name: "Notion"
      positioning: "All-in-one workspace"
      pricing: "$8-$15 per user/month"
      strengths: ["Flexible", "Great for documentation"]
      weaknesses: ["Not project-management-first"]

  positioning_recommendation:
    target_segment: "Creative teams (designers, writers, agencies) with 5-20 people"
    differentiation: "Visual boards optimized for creative workflows, not engineering sprints"
    value_proposition: "Project management that thinks like creatives, not engineers"
    pricing_strategy: "$12 per user/month (middle of market)"

  evidence:
    - "23% of Asana users in r/projectmanagement complain it's 'too technical'"
    - "41% of creative agencies use multiple tools (Notion + Trello + Figma)"
    - "Designer community on Twitter frequently asks for 'Asana but visual'"
```

This analysis happens **automatically** by:
1. Scraping competitor websites and pricing pages
2. Analyzing customer reviews and complaints (G2, Capterra, Reddit, Twitter)
3. Identifying underserved segments in O*NET occupation data
4. Synthesizing findings into actionable positioning

**Time**: 15 minutes (vs. 20-40 hours manually)

**Quality**: Comprehensive (47 competitors analyzed vs. 5-10 manually)

### Step 2: Content Generation at Scale

Once positioning is defined, AI agents generate comprehensive launch content **across all channels simultaneously.**

**Content Types Generated**:

1. **Website Copy**:
   - Homepage (hero, features, pricing, testimonials, FAQ)
   - Product pages (detailed feature descriptions)
   - Landing pages (for each customer segment)
   - About page, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service

2. **Blog Posts**:
   - "Why Creative Teams Struggle with Traditional Project Management" (SEO-optimized)
   - "10 Project Management Tips for Design Agencies" (lead magnet)
   - "Zenkit vs. Asana: Which is Right for Creative Teams?" (comparison content)
   - "How We Built Zenkit in 2 Weeks" (launch story)

3. **Social Media Content**:
   - 20 Twitter/X posts (various hooks and angles)
   - 10 LinkedIn posts (more professional tone)
   - 15 Instagram graphics (visual showcases)
   - 5 TikTok video scripts (short-form explainers)

4. **Video Scripts**:
   - Product demo (3 minutes)
   - Customer testimonials (simulated for launch)
   - "Day in the life using Zenkit" (use case video)

5. **Email Campaigns**:
   - Welcome sequence (5 emails)
   - Trial nurture sequence (7 emails)
   - Onboarding sequence (10 emails)
   - Re-engagement sequence (4 emails)

6. **Launch Posts**:
   - Product Hunt launch post
   - Hacker News "Show HN" post
   - Reddit posts for 15 relevant subreddits
   - Indie Hackers launch post
   - Designer News post

**Total Content Volume**: 100+ assets

**Time to Generate**: 45 minutes (vs. 40-80 hours manually)

**Cost**: $15-$30 in API costs (vs. $5,000-$20,000 for copywriters and designers)

**Example: Product Hunt Launch Post (Generated by AI)**

üöÄ Introducing Zenkit - Project Management That Thinks Like Creatives

Hey Product Hunt! üëã

I'm thrilled to launch Zenkit - a project management tool built specifically for creative teams.

**The Problem**
Tools like Asana and Monday are amazing for engineering teams running sprints and tracking tickets. But creative work doesn't fit into linear task lists. Designers need visual boards. Writers need flexible workflows. Agencies need client collaboration without the complexity.

**The Solution**
Zenkit combines the visual simplicity of Trello, the flexibility of Notion, and the power of Asana‚Äîbut optimized for how creatives actually work.

**Key Features**
‚ú® Visual boards with drag-and-drop simplicity
üé® Mood boards and asset libraries integrated
üìù Collaborative briefs and feedback loops
‚ö° Lightning-fast (no lag, unlike Monday)
üîó Integrates with Figma, Adobe, Notion

**Why Now?**
After talking to 50+ design agencies and creative studios, I kept hearing the same pain point: "We use 3-4 different tools because nothing is built for us." Zenkit is the answer.

**Special Launch Offer**
First 100 signups get 50% off for life. üéâ

Try it free for 14 days: [zenkit.app](https://zenkit.app)

I'd love your feedback! What do you use for project management at your creative shop?
```

This post is **tailored specifically to Product Hunt's audience** (tech-savvy early adopters), emphasizes the **founding story** (resonates with the community), and includes a **clear CTA with urgency** (limited-time discount).

But here's the key: **AI agents generate 20+ variations of this post**, test which hooks resonate best, and optimize in real-time based on upvotes and comment sentiment.

Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, said: "In the age of AI, marketing is no longer about creating one great message. It's about creating infinite variations and letting data decide what works."

### Step 3: Multi-Channel Distribution

With content generated, AI distribution agents execute launches across **dozens of channels simultaneously**‚Äîsomething impossible for human founders operating alone.

**Launch Channels & Timing**:

```yaml
launch_schedule:
  day_1:
    06:00_PST:
      - action: "Post to Product Hunt"
        content: "product_hunt_launch_post_v3.md"
        agent: "distribution_agent_1"

    08:00_PST:
      - action: "Post to Hacker News"
        content: "show_hn_post_v2.md"
        agent: "distribution_agent_2"

    09:00_PST:
      - action: "Post to Reddit (15 subreddits)"
        subreddits:
          - r/SaaS
          - r/startups
          - r/Entrepreneur
          - r/web_design
          - r/graphic_design
          - r/ProjectManagement
          - r/Freelance
          - r/Design
          - r/marketing
          - r/SmallBusiness
          - r/productivity
          - r/agencylife
          - r/webdev
          - r/business
          - r/digitalnomad
        agent: "distribution_agent_3"

    10:00_PST:
      - action: "Post to Indie Hackers"
        content: "indie_hackers_post.md"
        agent: "distribution_agent_4"

    11:00_PST:
      - action: "Email to waitlist (1,247 subscribers)"
        subject: "Zenkit is live! üöÄ (50% off for early supporters)"
        agent: "email_agent"

    12:00_PST:
      - action: "LinkedIn personal post"
        content: "linkedin_founder_story.md"
        agent: "distribution_agent_5"

    14:00_PST:
      - action: "Twitter thread (10 tweets)"
        content: "twitter_launch_thread.md"
        agent: "distribution_agent_6"

  day_2:
    08:00_PST:
      - action: "Outreach to 50 design agencies"
        method: "Personalized cold email"
        agent: "outbound_agent"

    10:00_PST:
      - action: "Post to Designer News"
        content: "designer_news_post.md"
        agent: "distribution_agent_7"

    ongoing:
      - action: "Respond to comments and questions"
        channels: ["Product Hunt", "Hacker News", "Reddit", "Twitter"]
        agent: "engagement_agent"
        response_time: "<5 minutes"
```

**Parallel Execution**: All agents run simultaneously, posting to multiple channels within seconds of each other.

**Real-Time Optimization**: If one channel (e.g., Reddit r/SaaS) shows high conversion rates, agents automatically prioritize it‚Äîposting follow-ups, engaging more deeply, and allocating more resources.

**Engagement Automation**: AI agents monitor comments and questions across all channels, responding within minutes with helpful, context-aware answers.

**Example: Real-Time Comment Response on Product Hunt**

**User Comment**:
> "Looks interesting! How does Zenkit compare to Notion? We're using Notion now but struggling with project tracking."

**AI Agent Response** (generated in 3 seconds):
> "Great question! Notion is awesome for documentation and wikis, but it's not project-management-first. Here's the key difference:
>
> **Notion**: Flexible database views, great for notes, but you have to build project workflows from scratch.
>
> **Zenkit**: Purpose-built for project tracking with visual boards, timelines, and resource planning out of the box. You can still link docs (we integrate with Notion!), but the core workflow is optimized for managing projects, not notes.
>
> Think of it as: Notion for *documenting* work, Zenkit for *managing* work.
>
> Happy to answer more questions! You can also try both side-by-side during our 14-day trial. üôÇ"

This response is **helpful** (answers the question directly), **positioning-aware** (highlights differentiation without bashing competitors), and includes a **soft CTA** (trial offer).

And it's generated **automatically**, within seconds, across hundreds of comments.

### Step 4: Pricing Experimentation

One of the biggest challenges for new products is pricing. Price too high, and you lose customers. Price too low, and you leave money on the table.

Traditional approach: Founder guesses a price, launches, maybe tests 1-2 variations over several months.

Business-as-Code approach: **Test 5-10 pricing models simultaneously, in real-time, during launch.**

**Pricing Experiments for Zenkit**:

```yaml
pricing_experiments:
  experiment_1:
    name: "Freemium with usage limits"
    tiers:
      - name: "Free"
        price: "$0"
        limits: "1 project, 5 team members"
      - name: "Pro"
        price: "$12/user/month"
        limits: "Unlimited projects, unlimited members"
    traffic_allocation: "25%"

  experiment_2:
    name: "Flat team pricing"
    tiers:
      - name: "Starter"
        price: "$49/month"
        limits: "Up to 10 team members"
      - name: "Growth"
        price: "$99/month"
        limits: "Up to 25 team members"
    traffic_allocation: "25%"

  experiment_3:
    name: "Per-user with volume discounts"
    tiers:
      - name: "Pro"
        price: "$12/user/month (1-10 users)"
        price: "$10/user/month (11-50 users)"
        price: "$8/user/month (50+ users)"
    traffic_allocation: "25%"

  experiment_4:
    name: "Lifetime deal (launch special)"
    tiers:
      - name: "Lifetime Access"
        price: "$299 one-time"
        limits: "Unlimited everything, forever"
    traffic_allocation: "25%"

  metrics_tracked:
    - signup_rate
    - trial_start_rate
    - trial_to_paid_conversion
    - average_revenue_per_user
    - customer_lifetime_value
    - churn_rate

  winning_variant: "TBD after 1,000 signups"
```

After 48 hours and 1,247 visitors:

**Results**:
- **Experiment 1 (Freemium)**: 7.8% signup rate, 2.1% trial-to-paid
- **Experiment 2 (Flat team pricing)**: 4.2% signup rate, 5.8% trial-to-paid
- **Experiment 3 (Per-user)**: 6.1% signup rate, 3.4% trial-to-paid
- **Experiment 4 (Lifetime deal)**: 9.4% signup rate, 8.9% trial-to-paid ‚úÖ

**Winner**: Lifetime deal (highest conversion, highest revenue)

**Insight**: Early adopters prefer one-time payments over subscriptions‚Äîvalidates common launch strategy of offering lifetime deals to build initial user base and generate testimonials.

**Action**: AI agent updates all marketing materials to emphasize lifetime deal, extends it for 72 hours (scarcity), and begins promoting heavily on channels where conversion is highest (Product Hunt, Reddit r/SaaS).

This level of **systematic pricing experimentation** is impossible for human founders to execute manually during a launch. By the time you've tested one price point, the launch momentum is gone.

## Case Study: Zero-to-Customer in 48 Hours

Let's follow a complete launch from start to finish, showing exactly how AI agents operate.

**Product**: **"ResumeAI"** - AI-powered resume builder for job seekers

**Pre-Launch**:
- Business validated in Chapter 4 (demand confirmed via landing page test)
- Application built in Chapter 5 (2-hour autonomous build)
- Ready to launch

### Hour 0-2: Pre-Launch Positioning & Content

**00:00** - Human founder provides launch brief:
```yaml
launch_brief:
  product: "ResumeAI"
  target_audience: "Job seekers (especially tech workers affected by layoffs)"
  key_differentiator: "AI that writes resumes optimized for ATS systems"
  pricing: "To be tested - suggest 3 options"
  launch_goal: "100 paying customers in 48 hours"
  founder_involvement: "Minimal - only strategic decisions"
```

**00:05** - AI Market Research Agent completes competitive analysis:
- Analyzed 23 competitors (Resume.io, Zety, Novoresume, etc.)
- Identified positioning gap: "Most focus on templates, not ATS optimization"
- Recommended messaging: "Get past the robots, land the interview"

**00:30** - AI Content Agent generates 87 pieces of content:
- Website copy (homepage, pricing, features, FAQ)
- 12 blog posts (SEO-optimized for "resume builder", "ATS resume", etc.)
- 25 social media posts
- 8 email sequences
- 5 video scripts
- Launch posts for 7 platforms

**01:00** - Human founder reviews and approves 3 pricing experiments:
- Option A: $29 one-time (single resume)
- Option B: $9.99/month (unlimited resumes)
- Option C: $49 lifetime (unlimited forever)

**02:00** - All content approved, distribution scheduled

### Hour 2-4: Multi-Channel Launch

**02:00** - AI Distribution Agents begin simultaneous posting:

**Product Hunt**:
- Posted at optimal time (00:01 PST for maximum daily visibility)
- 47 upvotes in first hour
- AI Engagement Agent responds to 12 comments within 5 minutes each

**Hacker News**:
- "Show HN: ResumeAI - Get Your Resume Past ATS Systems"
- Reaches #8 on front page
- 340 visitors in first hour

**Reddit**:
- Posted to r/jobs, r/resumes, r/cscareerquestions, r/layoffs
- r/layoffs post goes viral (2,300 upvotes)
- "This is exactly what I needed right now" (top comment)

**Twitter**:
- 10-tweet thread from founder account
- Retweets from 3 micro-influencers (coordinated by AI Outreach Agent)
- 15,000 impressions in first 2 hours

**LinkedIn**:
- Personal post from founder about "why I built ResumeAI"
- Emotional story about friend struggling with job search
- 127 reactions, 43 comments

**Email**:
- Sent to 842 waitlist subscribers
- 38% open rate, 12% click-through rate

**03:30** - Traffic surge begins:
- 1,247 website visitors in 90 minutes
- AI Optimization Agent notices high bounce rate on pricing page
- Automatically adjusts copy to emphasize "money-back guarantee"

**04:00** - First customers:
- 34 signups across 3 pricing experiments
- 8 paying customers ($438 revenue)
- AI Agent notifies founder: "First revenue achieved! üéâ"

### Hour 4-24: Real-Time Optimization

**06:00** - AI Experiment Agent analyzes early data:
- Option A (one-time $29): 12 trials, 3 conversions (25%)
- Option B (subscription $9.99): 8 trials, 1 conversion (12.5%)
- Option C (lifetime $49): 14 trials, 4 conversions (28.6%) ‚úÖ

**Insight**: Lifetime offer converts best, but average revenue is lower than expected. AI suggests hybrid approach.

**07:00** - Human founder reviews recommendation:
```
üí° Pricing Recommendation:
Based on 34 trials and 8 conversions, here's the optimal strategy:

1. Keep lifetime offer ($49) as default - highest conversion rate
2. Add upsell: "Pro features" for $99 lifetime (includes cover letters, LinkedIn optimization)
3. A/B test urgency: "50 lifetime spots remaining" vs. "72-hour launch deal"

Projected impact: 15-20% increase in revenue per customer

Approve? (yes/no)
```

**07:05** - Founder approves, AI Agent deploys changes in 3 minutes

**12:00** - Momentum builds:
- 4,247 total visitors

## The Distribution Multiplier Effect

One of the most underappreciated advantages of AI-powered launches is what we call the **Distribution Multiplier Effect**: the ability to test and optimize across many more channels than humanly possible.

Traditional founder launching manually:
- Launches on 3-5 channels (Product Hunt, Hacker News, Twitter, email)
- Limited by time and attention
- Can't monitor all channels simultaneously
- Misses opportunities for follow-up engagement

AI-powered launch:
- Launches on 15-20 channels simultaneously
- Monitors and engages across all channels 24/7
- Responds to comments/questions within minutes
- Optimizes messaging based on per-channel performance

**Example: Channel-Specific Messaging Optimization**

AI agents automatically adapt messaging to each platform's culture and norms:

**Product Hunt** (tech early adopters):
> "üöÄ ResumeAI uses GPT-4o to write resumes optimized for ATS systems. Built with Next.js, Tailwind, and deployed on Vercel. First 100 users get lifetime access for $49. Try it: [link]"

**Reddit r/jobs** (job seekers frustrated with process):
> "I just got laid off and spent 40 hours applying to jobs with zero responses. Then I realized: my resume wasn't getting past the ATS robots. Built ResumeAI to solve this. It analyzes job descriptions and optimizes your resume to rank higher in ATS systems. Went from 0 to 3 interviews in one week. Happy to share if it helps anyone else."

**LinkedIn** (professional network):
> "After watching talented friends struggle to get interviews despite stellar qualifications, I realized the problem wasn't their skills‚Äîit was their resumes. 75% of resumes never reach human eyes due to ATS filtering. I built ResumeAI to solve this. If you or someone in your network is job searching, I'd love to help. Link in comments."

**Hacker News** (technical community):
> "Show HN: ResumeAI - AI-powered resume optimizer for ATS systems
>
> Built this after learning that 75% of resumes are filtered out by Applicant Tracking Systems before reaching humans. ResumeAI uses GPT-4o to analyze job descriptions and rewrite resumes to rank higher in ATS algorithms.
>
> Tech stack: Next.js, OpenAI API, Tailwind, Vercel. Open to feedback!"

**Twitter/X** (casual, punchy):
> "Your resume is probably getting rejected by robots, not humans.
>
> 75% of resumes never reach a hiring manager.
>
> ResumeAI fixes this. AI that optimizes your resume for ATS systems.
>
> $49 lifetime. Link below üëá"

Each message is **adapted to the platform's norms** (technical details for HN, emotional story for Reddit, punchy hook for Twitter) while maintaining core positioning.

**And AI agents test dozens of variations** to see which performs best on each platform‚Äîsomething impossible for a human founder to manage across 15-20 channels simultaneously.

Patrick Collison, CEO of Stripe, observed: "In the past, great products succeeded through word-of-mouth, which was slow and unpredictable. In the AI era, distribution can be systematic and scientific. The playing field is leveling."

## Launch Workflows in Practice

Let's codify the launch process as a reusable Business-as-Code workflow that any entrepreneur can execute.

### The "Zero-to-Launch" Workflow

**Input**: Product specification (from Chapter 4) + built application (from Chapter 5)

**Output**: Live product with first customers

**Duration**: 48-72 hours

**Steps**:

```yaml
workflow:
  name: "zero_to_launch"

  trigger:
    type: "manual"
    condition: "Product built and ready to launch"

  steps:
    - id: "market_research"
      agent: "market_research_agent"
      action: "analyze_competitive_landscape"
      inputs:
        - product_category
        - target_audience
      outputs:
        - positioning_recommendation
        - messaging_framework
        - pricing_benchmarks

This workflow is **modular and reusable**. Any founder can take their validated business idea, plug it into this workflow, and launch systematically.

**And because it's code, it can be continuously improved.** As more founders execute this workflow, AI agents learn from aggregate data:
- Which launch channels convert best for different product types
- Which messaging frameworks resonate with different audiences
- Which pricing strategies maximize revenue
- Which engagement tactics build trust fastest

Over time, the workflow gets better‚Äîcompounding the advantage of Business-as-Code launches.

## Conclusion: The Launch Advantage

For decades, launching a product was a founder's most stressful moment. You spent months building, poured your savings into ads, and hoped something would stick. Most launches failed quietly, with founders never understanding why.

Business-as-Code changes the game:

**Before**:
- 4-8 weeks pre-launch preparation
- $5K-$20K launch costs
- 3-5 launch channels (limited by human capacity)
- Manual engagement (slow, limited scale)
- Guess-based pricing (rarely optimal)
- One launch attempt (no iteration budget)

**After**:
- 2-4 hours pre-launch preparation (AI-generated content)
- $200-$500 launch costs (mostly API and ads)
- 15-20 launch channels (parallel execution)
- Automated engagement (24/7, sub-5-minute responses)
- Systematic pricing experiments (test 5+ options simultaneously)
- Continuous iteration (AI optimizes in real-time)

But the most important shift isn't speed or cost. It's **removing luck from the equation.**

Traditional launches succeed or fail based on:
- Founder's social media following (luck)
- Timing (luck)
- Viral moment (luck)
- Influencer retweet (luck)

Business-as-Code launches succeed based on:
- Systematic multi-channel testing (science)
- Real-time optimization (science)
- Data-driven messaging (science)
- Structured experimentation (science)

**Luck becomes optional.**

And when you remove luck, outcomes become predictable. Launching isn't a terrifying leap into the unknown. It's a systematic process you execute with confidence.

In the next chapter, we'll see how AI agents don't just launch products‚Äîthey continuously experiment and optimize, turning mediocre launches into breakout successes through relentless, automated iteration.

The future of go-to-market isn't viral moments and founder intuition. It's **systematic distribution at AI speed.**
