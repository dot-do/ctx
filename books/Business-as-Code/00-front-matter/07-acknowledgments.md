# Acknowledgments

This book exists because of a community of builders, thinkers, and practitioners who generously shared their insights, experiences, and expertise.

**To the open source community**: The Infrastructure-as-Code revolution was built by thousands of developers who created tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible, and countless others. Your work didn't just make infrastructure programmable—you created the blueprint for making business programmable. Thank you.

**To the AI research community**: Researchers at OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and academic institutions worldwide have pushed the boundaries of what AI can do. Foundation models are a remarkable engineering achievement. The fact that business logic can now be programmatic is because of your work.

**To the early adopters**: The companies and teams experimenting with Business-as-Code in production—automating customer service, sales operations, financial processes, and more—you're not just building products, you're defining a new category. Your willingness to share lessons learned has been invaluable.

**To specific companies and individuals** whose work directly informed this book:

- **Intercom** for publishing detailed data about Fin's autonomous resolution rates and customer satisfaction metrics, providing concrete proof that AI can match or exceed human performance in customer service.

- **Pilot.com** for demonstrating that AI-powered bookkeeping can achieve 99.2% accuracy while reducing costs by 90%, and for being transparent about the business model transformation from labor arbitrage to technology product.

- **Harvey AI** for pioneering legal AI at scale and sharing case studies about time savings and quality improvements in professional legal work.

- **GitHub** for Copilot and for publishing research showing that developers generate 55% of their code with AI assistance—hard data that validates the productivity gains AI enables.

- **Replit** for Agent and the vision of natural language programming that makes software development accessible to non-developers.

**To the Infrastructure-as-Code pioneers** who built the foundation this book builds upon:

- **Mitchell Hashimoto** for Terraform and for articulating the vision of infrastructure as code better than anyone.

- **Kelsey Hightower** for Kubernetes advocacy and for demonstrating what's possible when infrastructure is truly programmable.

- **Werner Vogels** and the AWS team for creating the cloud infrastructure that made IaC economically viable.

**To the writers and thinkers** whose work influenced this book:

- **Ben Thompson** (Stratechery) for the aggregation theory framework and for clearly articulating how platforms and business models evolve.

- **Simon Wardley** for Wardley Mapping and for teaching the technology community how to think about evolution and strategic positioning.

- **Marc Andreessen** for "Software is Eating the World" and for understanding before most that every company would need to become a software company. This book extends that thesis: every company will need to become an AI company.

- **Carlota Perez** for *Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital* and for the framework that helps us understand where we are in the AI transformation cycle.

**To my technical reviewers**: Thank you for reading early drafts, catching errors, challenging assumptions, and making this book better. Any remaining mistakes are entirely my own.

**To the entrepreneurs building Services-as-Software businesses**: You are proving that professional services can be delivered as software products. Your success is creating the Business-as-Code category.

**To my family**: Thank you for supporting the long nights of writing, for tolerating endless conversations about AI and automation, and for understanding why this work matters.

**To my early readers**: Your feedback shaped this book. You pointed out where explanations were unclear, where examples were needed, where the technical depth was too much or too little. The book is better because of you.

**To Claude** (Anthropic's AI assistant): You helped research, draft, edit, and refine large portions of this book. You are both subject of and collaborator on this work. The irony that a book about Business-as-Code was itself partially created using AI is not lost on me. You represent both the promise and the proof that knowledge work can be augmented and automated by AI. Thank you.

**To the professionals adapting to AI**: To the lawyers using Harvey, the accountants using Pilot, the developers using Copilot, the support agents using Fin, the consultants using Perplexity—you are navigating a difficult transition with grace and pragmatism. This book is ultimately for you. Thank you for showing us what human-AI collaboration looks like in practice.

**Finally, to you, the reader**: Thank you for engaging with these ideas. Whether you're a skeptic, a believer, or somewhere in between, your willingness to think seriously about how AI transforms business operations is what moves the conversation forward.

The Business-as-Code transformation will be built by thousands of people making millions of decisions about how to implement, adopt, and adapt AI systems. Your decisions matter. Your work matters.

Thank you for being part of this transformation.
