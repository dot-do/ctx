# About the Author

**Nathan Clevenger** is an entrepreneur, software engineer, and writer focused on the intersection of AI and business transformation.

## Background

Nathan has spent his career building software and businesses at the leading edge of technological shifts. He was an early advocate of cloud computing and Infrastructure-as-Code, building systems on AWS when most companies still ran their own data centers. He watched IaC enable SaaS and saw firsthand how programmable infrastructure transformed enterprise software.

In 2022, with the release of ChatGPT and GPT-4, Nathan recognized a parallel transformation beginning: AI was making business logic programmable in the same way that Infrastructure-as-Code made infrastructure programmable. This insight became the foundation for *Business-as-Code* and its companion volume, *Services-as-Software*.

## Professional Experience

Nathan has built and scaled technology companies across multiple domains:

- **SaaS platforms**: Built subscription software businesses serving thousands of customers, navigating the challenges of scaling infrastructure, operations, and customer success.

- **API-first businesses**: Created developer tools and APIs used by millions of requests daily, understanding how programmability creates leverage.

- **AI-powered services**: Currently building Services-as-Software businesses that deliver professional services through AI agents rather than human labor.

Throughout these experiences, Nathan has been both builder and operatorâ€”writing code, managing teams, designing systems, and running P&Ls. This combination of technical depth and business perspective informs his writing.

## Writing and Research

Nathan writes about technology business models, AI transformation, and the patterns that repeat across technological revolutions. His work draws on:

- **First-hand implementation experience**: Building production AI systems, not just theorizing about them
- **Historical analysis**: Understanding how past technological shifts (cloud computing, mobile, internet) unfolded and applying those patterns to AI
- **Data-driven thinking**: Grounding arguments in measurable results from real systems (OpenAI GDPval, GitHub Copilot studies, Intercom Fin production data)

His writing has reached audiences ranging from technical developers to C-suite executives, with a focus on making complex technical concepts accessible while maintaining rigor.

## Philosophy

Nathan believes that:

1. **Technology transformations follow patterns**: Understanding how Infrastructure-as-Code enabled SaaS helps us understand how Business-as-Code enables Services-as-Software.

2. **Implementation matters more than theory**: Real production systems generating measurable results teach us more than hypothetical scenarios.

3. **Disruption is inevitable but navigation is not**: Those who understand transformation patterns early can adapt successfully rather than be disrupted.

4. **Transparency helps everyone**: Sharing real data, honest challenges, and practical implementation details advances the field faster than hype or secrecy.

5. **The goal is abundance**: Business-as-Code and Services-as-Software should democratize access to capabilities that were previously scarce and expensive, creating value broadly rather than just extracting it.

## Other Work

In addition to *Business-as-Code* and *Services-as-Software*, Nathan has:

- Built open source tools for AI development and business automation
- Advised companies on AI implementation strategy
- Spoken at technology conferences about AI transformation patterns
- Written extensively about cloud computing, APIs, and software architecture

## Acknowledgment

This book was written in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant), demonstrating the very thesis it explores: professional-grade writing, research, and analysis can be accomplished through human-AI collaboration. Nathan provided direction, structure, and editorial oversight; Claude assisted with research, drafting, and refinement. The result is a book about Business-as-Code that was itself created using Business-as-Code principles.

## Other Books by Nathan Clevenger

**Services-as-Software: How AI Is Transforming the $4.6 Trillion Professional Services Industry** (2025)

Companion volume examining Services-as-Software specifically: how AI is transforming legal services, accounting, software development, consulting, customer support, and creative services. While *Business-as-Code* explores the broad transformation across all business functions, *Services-as-Software* focuses on professional services disruption in depth.

Both books share a central thesis: **Infrastructure-as-Code enabled Software-as-a-Service :: Business-as-Code enables Services-as-Software**. Together, they provide a complete picture of AI's impact on business operations and professional work.
