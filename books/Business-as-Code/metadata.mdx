# Book: Business-as-Code

**How AI Agents Are Building, Launching, and Scaling Autonomous Enterprises**

## Blurb

After Marc Andreessen declared "Software is Eating the World" in 2011, we witnessed digital transformation reshape every industry. Now, the next revolution is here—and it's autonomous.

In Business-as-Code, Nathan Clevenger and Bryant Skarda reveal how AI agents are not just automating tasks—they're ideating, building, launching, and scaling entire businesses with unprecedented speed and efficiency. Drawing on insights from industry titans like Bill Gates, Satya Nadella, Marc Benioff, and Jensen Huang, this groundbreaking book shows how the same architectural breakthrough that enabled Infrastructure-as-Code to unlock Software-as-a-Service is now enabling Business-as-Code to unlock Services-as-Software.

You'll discover:
- How AI agents autonomously generate, test, and refine business ideas
- The Business-as-Code architecture powering the $4.6 trillion opportunity
- Real-world case studies of AI-native businesses achieving 25-40% efficiency gains
- OpenAI GDPval data showing AI performing at 47.6% expert parity, 100x faster and cheaper
- A practical implementation framework grounded in ONET occupations and NAICS industries
- The semantic ontology (Schema.org, GS1 EPCIS) enabling autonomous operations

Whether you're a founder, executive, or innovator, Business-as-Code provides the roadmap to thrive in the era of autonomous business.
