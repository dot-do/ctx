# Book 7: Building Business-as-Code

## Brief

**Full Title**: Building Business-as-Code: A Practical Guide for Non-Technical Builders

**Subtitle**: How to Automate Business Operations Without Writing Code

**Target Audience**: Product managers, operations people, domain experts, "vibe coders" who want to build but lack traditional programming skills

**Primary Reader**: 25-50 years old, understands business processes, wants to automate, intimidated by traditional coding

**Page Count**: 250-300 pages

**Tone**: Accessible, encouraging, hands-on, practical, "you can do this"

## Core Premise

Business logic is now programmable through AI, and you don't need to be a software engineer to build Business-as-Code systems. Using accessible tools (especially SDK.do), domain experts can automate business operations themselves. This book is a practical, hands-on guide.

**Not**: "Learn to code first" (unnecessary)
**Not**: "No-code is limited" (dismissive)
**Is**: "Here's how to build real business automation with accessible tools"

## Key Questions Answered

1. Can I really build business automation without coding?
2. What tools do I use? (SDK.do platform focus)
3. How do I turn a business process into an automated workflow?
4. How do I handle errors and edge cases?
5. How do I integrate with existing systems?
6. How do I test that my automation works correctly?
7. How do I measure ROI and improvement?
8. When do I need a developer vs. build myself?

## Key Themes

### 1. You Can Do This
Empowering message: domain expertise + accessible tools = powerful automation

### 2. Start Simple, Iterate
Don't try to automate everything. Start with one workflow. Learn. Expand.

### 3. Tools Over Code
Focus on SDK.do platform and other accessible tools. Minimize traditional coding.

### 4. Business Logic First
Think about the process, the rules, the decisions. Tools handle technical details.

### 5. Real Business Value
Every project produces measurable improvement. Not just learning exercises.

## Differentiation from Other Books

**Book 1 (Business-as-Code)**: Why business logic is programmable
**Book 7 (This book)**: How to actually build it (non-technical)
**Book 9 (Advanced BaC)**: Deep technical implementation

**Relationship**: Book 1 explains the concept. Book 7 teaches non-technical implementation. Book 9 is for professional developers.

## SDK.do Platform Focus

This book explicitly teaches the SDK.do platform as the primary tool:

### SDK.do Capabilities Covered:
- **AI Agents**: Pre-built agents for common business tasks
- **Workflow Builder**: Visual workflow designer
- **Integration Hub**: Connect to existing systems (Salesforce, QuickBooks, etc.)
- **Knowledge Bases**: Upload documents, create searchable knowledge
- **Testing Tools**: Validate automation before deployment
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Track performance and errors
- **Template Library**: Start from proven patterns

### Why SDK.do?
- Designed for non-technical builders
- Business-process-first design
- Handles AI complexity behind the scenes
- Pre-built integrations with business tools
- Visual debugging and monitoring
- Templates for common business processes

## Hands-On Projects Structure

Each project chapter follows this pattern:

1. **Business Problem**: What are we solving?
2. **Process Today**: How it works manually (time, cost, errors)
3. **Automation Design**: Break down the workflow
4. **Build**: Step-by-step using SDK.do (screenshots, detailed steps)
5. **Test**: How to verify it works
6. **Deploy**: Put it into production
7. **Measure**: Track improvements (time saved, cost reduced, quality improved)
8. **Iterate**: Common improvements and extensions

**Real Examples, Real Numbers**: Each project shows actual time/cost savings
