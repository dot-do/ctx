Readers learn which of their current skills to double down on and which to evolve beyond.

**Key Takeaways**:
- Categorize your skills into the five-tier framework
- Understand why execution skills depreciate while judgment skills appreciate
- Identify the "orchestration layer" skills that become newly valuable

- Recognize that speed of skill acquisition becomes a competitive advantage

**Action Items**:
- Inventory your current skills using the five-category framework
- Identify 3-5 commodity skills to delegate to AI within 6 months
