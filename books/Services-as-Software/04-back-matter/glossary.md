# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout *Services-as-Software* and its companion volume, *Business-as-Code*.

---

**Agent** - An AI system that can perform tasks autonomously, make decisions, use tools, and interact with external systems. Agents combine foundation models with memory, planning, and tool use capabilities.

**Anthropic** - AI safety company that created Claude, a family of foundation models optimized for helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty.

**API (Application Programming Interface)** - A set of defined methods for software components to communicate. APIs enable programmability and integration.

**Augmentation** - The first phase of AI adoption where AI assists humans but doesn't replace them. Humans remain in control and review all AI outputs.

**Automation Potential** - The percentage of a task or job that can be performed by AI without human involvement, measured on technical capability.

**AWS (Amazon Web Services)** - Amazon's cloud computing platform that pioneered Infrastructure-as-a-Service and enabled the cloud computing revolution.

**BaC (Business-as-Code)** - The practice of encoding business logic, processes, and decisions as executable code (typically AI systems) rather than manual human procedures. Parallel to Infrastructure-as-Code but for business operations.

**Business Logic** - The rules, processes, and decision-making that define how a business operates. Examples: pricing rules, approval workflows, customer segmentation logic.

**Chatbot** - A conversational AI system that interacts with users via text or voice. Modern chatbots use foundation models for natural language understanding and generation.

**Claude** - A family of foundation models created by Anthropic, known for long context windows (200K tokens) and strong performance on analysis and reasoning tasks.

**Cloud Computing** - The delivery of computing resources (servers, storage, databases, networking) over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. Enabled by Infrastructure-as-Code.

**Copilot** - GitHub's AI pair programming tool that suggests code completions and generates code from natural language descriptions. Based on OpenAI Codex.

**Embedding** - A numerical representation of text, images, or other data that captures semantic meaning. Enables semantic search and RAG systems.

**Fine-tuning** - The process of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to a specific task or domain by training on additional specialized data.

**Foundation Model** - A large-scale AI model trained on broad data at scale that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks. Examples: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini.

**GDPval** - OpenAI's research study that measured AI performance against human experts across 44 occupations, finding 47.6% expert parity at 100x speed and cost advantage.

**Gemini** - Google's family of multimodal foundation models with industry-leading context windows (1M+ tokens) and tight integration with Google Cloud.

**GitHub Copilot** - See Copilot.

**GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)** - The architecture and model family created by OpenAI. GPT-4 and GPT-4o are the current state-of-the-art versions.

**Hallucination** - When an AI model generates false or fabricated information with confidence. A key limitation requiring human review of AI outputs.

**Harvey AI** - An AI platform specialized for legal services, offering legal research, contract analysis, and document drafting capabilities.

**IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code)** - The practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable definition files rather than manual configuration. Enabled cloud computing at scale.

**Intercom Fin** - An AI customer support agent that autonomously resolves 72% of support tickets with higher satisfaction than human agents.

**LangChain** - A popular open-source framework for building applications with foundation models, offering tools for chaining operations, memory, and agent orchestration.

**LLM (Large Language Model)** - A type of foundation model specifically trained on text data to understand and generate natural language. GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini are LLMs.

**LlamaIndex** - An open-source framework specialized for building RAG applications, providing tools for data ingestion, indexing, and retrieval.

**Midjourney** - An AI system that generates images from text descriptions, widely used for creative and marketing applications.

**Multi-Agent System** - An AI system composed of multiple specialized agents that collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. Each agent has distinct capabilities and responsibilities.

**OpenAI** - AI research company that created GPT-4 and pioneered modern foundation models. Known for ChatGPT, GPT-4, and DALL-E.

**Pilot.com** - A company offering AI-powered bookkeeping services, achieving 99.2% accuracy while reducing costs 90% compared to traditional bookkeeping.

**Platformization** - The final phase of AI adoption where services become self-serve platforms that end users access directly without professional intermediaries.

**Prompt** - The input provided to an AI model, typically text instructions describing the desired output. Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective prompts.

**Prompt Engineering** - The practice of designing effective prompts to elicit desired outputs from foundation models. A critical skill in the AI era.

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** - A technique that enhances AI responses by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base before generating an answer. Combines search with generation.

**Replit Agent** - An AI system that builds complete applications from natural language descriptions, generating code, infrastructure, and deployment configuration.

**SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)** - The delivery of software as a centrally-hosted service accessed via the internet, typically on a subscription basis. Examples: Salesforce, Workday, Slack.

**SaS (Services-as-Software)** - The delivery of professional services (legal, accounting, consulting, etc.) as AI-powered software products rather than human labor. Enabled by Business-as-Code.

**Semantic Search** - Search that understands meaning and context rather than just keyword matching. Enabled by embeddings and vector databases.

**Substitution** - The second phase of AI adoption where AI performs complete workflows autonomously without human review, at least for standardized tasks.

**Terraform** - A popular Infrastructure-as-Code tool for defining cloud infrastructure in declarative configuration files. Pioneered by HashiCorp.

**Token** - The basic unit of text that foundation models process. Roughly equivalent to 3/4 of a word in English. Pricing and context limits are measured in tokens.

**Vector Database** - A database optimized for storing and searching embeddings. Critical infrastructure for RAG systems. Examples: Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma.

**Workflow** - A defined sequence of steps or tasks that accomplish a business objective. AI agents can execute workflows that previously required human coordination.
