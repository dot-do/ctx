# About the Author

**Nathan Clevenger** is an entrepreneur, software engineer, and writer focused on the intersection of AI and business transformation.

## Background

Nathan has spent his career building software and businesses at the leading edge of technological shifts. He was an early advocate of cloud computing and Infrastructure-as-Code, building systems on AWS when most companies still ran their own data centers. He watched IaC enable SaaS and saw firsthand how programmable infrastructure transformed enterprise software.

In 2022, with the release of ChatGPT and GPT-4, Nathan recognized a parallel transformation beginning: AI was making business logic programmable in the same way that Infrastructure-as-Code made infrastructure programmable. He saw that this would enable professional services to be delivered as software products rather than human labor—Services-as-Software.

## Professional Experience

Nathan has built and scaled technology companies across multiple domains:

- **SaaS platforms**: Built subscription software businesses serving thousands of customers, navigating the challenges of scaling infrastructure, operations, and customer success.

- **API-first businesses**: Created developer tools and APIs used by millions of requests daily, understanding how programmability creates leverage.

- **Services-as-Software**: Currently building businesses that deliver professional services (legal research, financial analysis, customer support) through AI systems rather than human labor.

Throughout these experiences, Nathan has been both builder and operator—writing code, managing teams, designing systems, and running P&Ls. This combination of technical depth and business perspective informs his writing.

## Writing and Research

Nathan writes about technology business models, AI transformation, and the disruption of professional services. His work is characterized by:

- **Data-driven analysis**: Grounding arguments in real production metrics (OpenAI GDPval, Intercom Fin results, GitHub Copilot data) rather than speculation

- **Pattern recognition**: Identifying how transformations repeat across industries and applying lessons from past disruptions (cloud, mobile, internet) to AI

- **Implementation focus**: Providing practical guidance for both professionals navigating change and entrepreneurs building Services-as-Software businesses

- **Balanced perspective**: Honest about both the opportunities AI creates and the disruptions it causes

His writing reaches audiences from technical developers to C-suite executives to frontline professionals facing AI-driven change.

## Philosophy

Nathan believes that:

1. **Professional services transformation is inevitable**: The technology is proven, the economics are compelling, and the pattern matches previous disruptions (IaC → SaaS :: BaC → SaS).

2. **Transparency helps everyone adapt**: Sharing real data about AI capabilities and limitations enables better planning than hype or fear.

3. **Professionals can thrive if they adapt**: The skills that matter in an AI era (strategic thinking, domain expertise, relationship building) are teachable and valuable.

4. **Services-as-Software should democratize expertise**: The goal is not just disruption for its own sake, but making professional services accessible to those who previously couldn't afford them.

5. **Builders should move responsibly**: Services-as-Software entrepreneurs have both economic opportunity and social responsibility to manage disruption thoughtfully.

## Other Work

In addition to *Services-as-Software* and *Business-as-Code*, Nathan has:

- Built AI-powered professional services products (legal, financial, support)
- Advised professional services firms on AI implementation
- Spoken at legal, accounting, and technology conferences about Services-as-Software transformation
- Written extensively about SaaS business models and software architecture
- Contributed to open source AI tooling and frameworks

## Acknowledgment

This book was written in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant), demonstrating a key thesis of Services-as-Software: professional-grade research, analysis, and writing can be accomplished through human-AI collaboration. Nathan provided direction, structure, domain expertise, and editorial judgment; Claude assisted with research, drafting, data synthesis, and refinement.

The result is a book about Services-as-Software that was itself created using Services-as-Software principles—showing both the capabilities and the limitations of AI-augmented professional work.

## Other Books by Nathan Clevenger

**Business-as-Code: How AI Makes Every Company a Software Company** (2025)

Companion volume examining Business-as-Code broadly: how AI makes business logic programmable across all business functions (customer service, sales, operations, finance, HR). While *Services-as-Software* focuses specifically on professional services disruption, *Business-as-Code* explores the broader transformation affecting all companies.

Both books share a central thesis: **Infrastructure-as-Code enabled Software-as-a-Service :: Business-as-Code enables Services-as-Software**. Together, they provide a complete picture of AI's impact on business operations and professional work.
