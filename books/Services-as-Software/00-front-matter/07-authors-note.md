# Author's Note

In February 2024, I received an email from my company's outside counsel—a senior partner at a top-tier law firm. The subject line: "We need to talk about Harvey."

Harvey AI, for context, is an AI-powered legal research and document drafting tool built specifically for law firms. The partner's email was concerned but pragmatic: Their firm had been piloting Harvey for six months. Junior associates who previously spent 8-10 hours on legal research were completing the same work in 45 minutes to 2 hours with Harvey's assistance. Contract drafting that took 4-6 hours now took 30-45 minutes.

The partner wasn't worried about the technology—he was worried about the business model. Their firm billed by the hour. If Harvey made their associates 5-10x more productive, they could either:

1. Bill one-fifth the hours (devastating to revenue)
2. Serve 5x as many clients with the same team (possible but required massive sales and client acquisition)
3. Not tell clients about Harvey and continue billing traditional hours (ethically problematic and unsustainable)

"The hourly billing model," he wrote, "is about to become untenable. We don't know what replaces it."

That email crystalized something I'd been observing for months: AI wasn't just making professionals more productive—it was making the entire business model of professional services obsolete.

This book is about that transformation.

**The Pattern**

In the companion volume, *Business-as-Code*, I explored how AI makes business logic programmable, following the same pattern that Infrastructure-as-Code enabled Software-as-a-Service. That book examines the broad transformation: how AI changes business operations across all functions and industries.

This book narrows the focus to one of the largest and most significant sectors: professional services.

$4.6 trillion in annual spending flows through the U.S. professional services economy—legal, accounting, consulting, software development, customer support, creative services. These industries share a common business model: skilled professionals billing for their time.

That business model is being disrupted by AI in the same way that cloud computing disrupted on-premise software, in the same way that streaming disrupted media, in the same way that e-commerce disrupted retail.

The pattern is:

**Infrastructure-as-Code → Software-as-a-Service**

**Business-as-Code → Services-as-Software**

In the first transformation, infrastructure became programmable (Terraform, Kubernetes), which enabled software to be delivered as a service (Salesforce, Workday) rather than a product. In the second transformation, professional expertise becomes programmable (via AI), which enables services to be delivered as software rather than human labor.

Both transformations follow the same structure:
1. A scarce, expensive, manually-delivered resource (infrastructure capacity, professional expertise)
2. Becomes abundant, cheap, and programmatically-delivered (via cloud APIs, via AI)
3. Enabling new business models (subscription software, subscription services)
4. That undercut incumbents by 90%+ on price (cloud vs. on-premise, AI services vs. hourly billing)
5. While often delivering better or comparable quality

**The Evidence**

Unlike most books about AI's impact on work, which rely heavily on speculation and hypotheticals, this book is grounded in data from production systems operating at scale *today*:

- **OpenAI's GDPval study** (2024): AI systems achieved 47.6% expert parity across 44 white-collar occupations while operating 100x faster and 100x cheaper than human experts

- **Allen & Overy** (2024): 70% reduction in legal research time using Harvey AI, with quality matching or exceeding human work

- **Intercom** (2024): Fin AI resolves 72% of customer support tickets autonomously with 4.6/5.0 satisfaction (higher than human agents' 4.3/5.0)

- **GitHub** (2024): Copilot users generate 55% of their code with AI assistance and complete tasks 55% faster

- **Pilot.com** (2024): AI bookkeeping achieves 99.2% accuracy while reducing costs 85-90%, enabling growth from $50M to $120M ARR while reducing bookkeeper headcount from 200+ to 30

These are not pilot programs or marketing claims. These are production systems processing millions of transactions, serving thousands of customers, and generating measurable business value.

The transformation is not theoretical. It is happening now.

**The Three Phases**

The book tracks Services-as-Software through three phases:

**Phase 1: Augmentation (2023-2025)**
AI assists professionals, making them faster and more productive. Lawyers use Harvey to draft contracts. Accountants use Pilot for bookkeeping. Developers use Copilot for code generation. The professional remains in control, but AI handles the routine work.

We are living through this phase now. Most professional services firms are experimenting with AI tools. Productivity gains are real but the business model remains intact. Hourly billing still works because professionals are billing for their time, just completing more work in that time.

**Phase 2: Substitution (2025-2027)**
AI performs complete workflows autonomously, without human review, for standardized high-volume work. Intercom Fin resolving 72% of support tickets autonomously is an early example of substitution—the AI isn't assisting human agents, it's replacing them for most tickets.

Over the next 2-4 years, substitution will accelerate. Junior associate work in law firms will be 60-80% automated. Bookkeeping for SMBs will be 90%+ automated. Code generation for standard features will be 70%+ automated. Market research and data analysis will be 60-80% automated.

The business model breaks during substitution. You can't bill for junior associate hours if AI does the work in 5 minutes instead of 10 hours. Professional services firms will need to transition to value-based pricing, outcome-based pricing, or subscription models.

**Phase 3: Platformization (2027-2030)**
Services-as-Software matures into standardized platforms that end users access directly, without professional intermediaries. Just as TurboTax enabled individuals to prepare their own taxes (previously requiring an accountant) and LegalZoom enabled entrepreneurs to form businesses (previously requiring a lawyer), AI platforms will enable non-experts to access professional-grade capabilities directly.

Platformization is the final stage. Professional services become software products. The mass market is served by platforms. Professionals focus on complex, high-stakes, customized work that still requires human judgment.

**Who This Book Is For**

This book has three primary audiences:

**1. Professionals in services industries**: Lawyers, accountants, consultants, developers, support agents, marketers—anyone whose career involves selling expertise for time. This book is a roadmap for navigating the transformation. It's honest about what work will be automated, but also clear about what remains valuable and how to position yourself for success in an AI-augmented world.

**2. Entrepreneurs and business builders**: If you're building or considering building a Services-as-Software company, this book is a playbook. It examines the technology stack, the business models, the go-to-market strategies, and the pitfalls. It profiles successful companies (Harvey, Pilot, Intercom, Jasper) and extracts the patterns.

**3. Business leaders and operators**: If you buy professional services (and every company does—legal, accounting, consulting, development, support), this book helps you understand how AI will change what you buy, how much you pay, and who you buy from. It also helps you understand how to implement AI within your own service delivery if you operate a services business.

**How This Book Is Structured**

**Part I: The Great Unbundling** examines why professional services are vulnerable to AI disruption, how the technology enables Services-as-Software, and what the $4.6 trillion opportunity looks like.

**Part II: The Transformation Playbook** goes industry by industry—legal, accounting, software development, consulting, customer support, creative services—examining how Services-as-Software is transforming each sector with detailed case studies and data.

**Part III: The Human Element** addresses what happens to professionals (how to adapt and thrive) and how to build Services-as-Software businesses (the entrepreneur's playbook).

You can read the book cover to cover, or jump to the chapters most relevant to your industry or interests.

**A Note on Timing**

This book documents a transformation that is happening in real time. By the time you read this, some of the examples and data points will be outdated—AI capabilities are improving every month, new companies are launching, new use cases are emerging.

I've tried to focus on durable patterns and principles rather than specific capabilities that will quickly become obsolete. The core thesis—that professional services are being transformed from labor-intensive services into AI-powered software products—will remain valid even as specific technologies evolve.

If you're reading this in 2025, you're early. Most professional services firms haven't yet grappled with the implications of Services-as-Software. Most professionals haven't adapted their skills and positioning. Most entrepreneurs haven't yet built category-defining Services-as-Software companies.

If you're reading this in 2027 or later, the transformation I describe will already be well underway. Substitution will be mainstream. The business model disruption will be acute. The question will no longer be whether Services-as-Software happens, but whether you adapted quickly enough.

**The Companion Volume**

This book focuses specifically on professional services transformation. The companion volume, *Business-as-Code*, examines the broader phenomenon: how AI makes all business logic programmable and what that means for companies across all industries.

You can read either book independently, but they're designed to complement each other:

- Read *Business-as-Code* if you're interested in how AI transforms business operations broadly (customer service, sales, operations, finance, HR)

- Read *Services-as-Software* if you're specifically interested in professional services disruption (legal, accounting, consulting, development, support, creative)

Both books share a core thesis: We're witnessing a transformation comparable to the shift from on-premise software to cloud-based SaaS, and it follows the same pattern—programmability enables new business models that disrupt incumbents.

**A Personal Note**

I've spent my career building software and businesses at the intersection of emerging technologies. I built companies during the cloud computing revolution. I watched IaC and SaaS transform enterprise software. I'm now building companies in the AI era.

This book reflects that experience: It's written by someone who has built production systems using these technologies, who has made hiring and business model decisions based on AI capabilities, and who has seen firsthand what works and what doesn't.

But I'm also a customer of professional services. I've hired lawyers, accountants, consultants, developers, and support teams. I've experienced the frustration of hourly billing—paying $400/hour for work that could have been done in minutes with the right tools. I've seen the value of great professionals who provide strategic insight beyond just executing tasks.

This book is sympathetic to both sides: the professionals whose livelihoods are being disrupted, and the customers who have long paid high prices for services that can now be delivered better and cheaper with AI.

My hope is that this book helps professionals navigate the transition successfully, helps entrepreneurs build Services-as-Software businesses responsibly, and helps society manage the economic implications thoughtfully.

The end of the hour has arrived. Professional services will never be the same.

Let's understand what that means.
