# Acknowledgments

This book exists because professionals across industries have been generous with their time, candid about their experiences, and willing to share both successes and failures as they navigate the transformation to Services-as-Software.

**To the professionals adapting to AI:**

The lawyers who embraced Harvey AI despite concerns about billable hours. The accountants who automated bookkeeping and focused on advisory services. The developers who learned to work with GitHub Copilot. The support agents who became AI orchestrators rather than ticket responders. You are showing the rest of the industry what successful adaptation looks like. Thank you.

**To the companies that shared data and insights:**

**OpenAI** for publishing the GDPval study that provided rigorous, quantitative evidence of AI's capabilities across 44 occupations. The 47.6% expert parity finding—along with 100x speed and cost advantages—is the most important piece of research validating Services-as-Software economics.

**Intercom** for extraordinary transparency about Fin's performance (72% autonomous resolution, 4.6/5.0 satisfaction) and about your own internal transformation (85 agents → 25 agents). Your willingness to share real production metrics set the standard for AI transparency.

**Pilot.com** for demonstrating that AI bookkeeping can achieve 99.2% accuracy at scale, and for being open about the business model transformation from labor arbitrage to technology product. Your journey from $50M to $120M ARR while reducing bookkeepers by 85% is the Services-as-Software playbook in practice.

**Harvey AI** for pioneering legal AI and sharing case studies about how Allen & Overy achieved 70% time reduction in legal research. Your work proved that AI can match professional-grade legal work.

**GitHub** for Copilot and for publishing data showing that developers generate 55% of their code with AI assistance—hard numbers that validated the productivity gains everyone was experiencing anecdotally.

**Foundation Capital** for the research identifying $4.6 trillion in Services-as-Software opportunity and for articulating the business model implications clearly.

**To the professional services firms navigating transformation:**

The law firm partner who emailed about Harvey and billing model concerns. The accounting firm that shared their automation roadmap. The consulting firm experimenting with AI-powered research tools. You face difficult decisions about business model transformation. Your willingness to engage with these challenges openly has informed this book.

**To the entrepreneurs building Services-as-Software:**

You're building the companies that will define this category. Some of you will create billion-dollar businesses. Some will fail. All of you are pushing the boundaries of what's possible. Your collective experimentation is teaching the market what works. Thank you for building in public and sharing what you learn.

**To the researchers and thought leaders:**

**Ben Thompson** (Stratechery) for articulation of how platforms and business models evolve, and for the aggregation theory framework that helps explain how AI platforms will capture value in professional services.

**Ethan Mollick** (Wharton) for rigorous research on AI's impact on professional work and for consistently publishing findings that help us understand real-world productivity gains.

**Andrew Ng** for pioneering AI education and for helping the broader business community understand what AI can and cannot do.

**Sam Altman** and the OpenAI team for GPT-4 and for the vision that AI should augment human capabilities broadly, not just serve narrow use cases.

**Dario Amodei** and the Anthropic team for Claude and for the commitment to building AI systems that are helpful, harmless, and honest—qualities essential for professional services applications.

**To my technical reviewers:**

The lawyers who reviewed the legal services chapter. The accountants who reviewed the accounting chapter. The developers who reviewed the software development chapter. Your domain expertise caught errors and added nuance. Thank you.

**To the professionals whose careers are disrupted:**

To the junior associates whose document review work is automated. To the bookkeepers whose reconciliation work is handled by AI. To the support agents whose ticket resolution is automated. To the analysts whose research is done by AI tools.

Your work has been valuable. The fact that AI can now do some of what you do doesn't diminish the expertise you built. I hope this book helps you understand how to adapt and where your skills remain valuable. The transition will be difficult. You deserve support, not just disruption.

**To my family:**

Thank you for understanding why this book matters, for tolerating the long hours of writing and research, and for engaging with the ideas even when they raised uncomfortable questions about the future of work.

**To Claude** (Anthropic's AI assistant):

You helped research, draft, and refine significant portions of this book. You represent both the subject and the proof: professional-grade writing, research, and analysis can be augmented by AI. Working with you has been a demonstration of what human-AI collaboration can achieve. Thank you.

**To the readers:**

Thank you for engaging with these ideas seriously. The Services-as-Software transformation will unfold differently depending on how professionals, entrepreneurs, and policymakers respond. Your decisions—how to position your career, what companies to build, what policies to support—will shape whether this transformation is managed well or poorly.

The end of hourly billing is inevitable. How we navigate the transition is not.

Thank you for being thoughtful about how to build the future of professional services.
