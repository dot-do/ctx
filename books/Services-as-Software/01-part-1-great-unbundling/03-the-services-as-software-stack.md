# Chapter 3: The Services-as-Software Stack

In 2006, Amazon Web Services launched EC2—Elastic Compute Cloud. For the first time, anyone could rent servers by the hour without calling a sales rep, signing contracts, or buying hardware.

**The insight wasn't technical—it was architectural.**

AWS abstracted infrastructure into **layers**:
- **Layer 1: Physical hardware** (servers, networking, storage)
- **Layer 2: Virtualization** (hypervisors, virtual machines)
- **Layer 3: APIs** (EC2, S3, RDS for programmatic control)
- **Layer 4: Orchestration** (CloudFormation, Terraform for Infrastructure-as-Code)

Each layer built on the previous, enabling higher-level abstractions. Developers stopped managing servers and started describing infrastructure as code.

**The same pattern is repeating with Services-as-Software.**

Just as AWS abstracted infrastructure into layers, Services-as-Software abstracts professional services into layers:
- **Layer 1: Foundation Models** (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5)
- **Layer 2: Knowledge Systems** (RAG, vector databases, semantic search)
- **Layer 3: Agent Orchestration** (LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGPT)
- **Layer 4: Domain Expertise** (Harvey AI for legal, Pilot for accounting)
- **Layer 5: Business Logic** (Business-as-Code specifications, YAML-LD workflows)

This chapter details the complete Services-as-Software stack—the architecture, components, and patterns enabling autonomous professional services delivery.

## Layer 1: Foundation Models

Foundation models are the compute substrate of Services-as-Software—analogous to CPUs and GPUs in traditional computing.

### The Big Three

**GPT-4o** (OpenAI, 2024):
- **Parameters**: ~1.8 trillion (estimated)
- **Context window**: 128,000 tokens (~96,000 words)
- **Modality**: Text, vision, audio (true multimodal)
- **Strengths**: Reasoning, coding, creative writing
- **Cost**: $2.50 per 1M input tokens, $10 per 1M output tokens
- **API**: REST, Python SDK, JavaScript SDK

**Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (Anthropic, 2024):
- **Parameters**: ~500 billion (estimated)
- **Context window**: 200,000 tokens (~150,000 words)
- **Modality**: Text, vision
- **Strengths**: Analysis, long-form reasoning, safety
- **Cost**: $3 per 1M input tokens, $15 per 1M output tokens
- **API**: REST, Python SDK, JavaScript SDK

**Gemini 1.5 Pro** (Google, 2024):
- **Parameters**: Undisclosed
- **Context window**: 2,000,000 tokens (~1.5M words)
- **Modality**: Text, vision, video, audio
- **Strengths**: Massive context, multimodal reasoning
- **Cost**: $1.25 per 1M input tokens, $5 per 1M output tokens
- **API**: REST, Python SDK, JavaScript SDK

### Why Multiple Models?

Services-as-Software platforms don't choose one model—they orchestrate multiple models for different tasks.

**Example routing strategy**:

```python
def route_to_model(task_type, complexity, budget):
    if task_type == "coding":
        if complexity == "high":
            return "gpt-4o"  # Best coding performance
        else:
            return "claude-3.5-haiku"  # Faster, cheaper

    elif task_type == "analysis":
        if len(context) > 100_000:
            return "gemini-1.5-pro"  # Massive context window
        else:
            return "claude-3.5-sonnet"  # Best reasoning

    elif task_type == "legal_research":
        # Use specialized fine-tuned model
        return "harvey-legal-pro"

    else:
        # Default to cost-optimized model
        return "gpt-4o-mini"
```

**Real-world example**: Harvey AI routes legal research to fine-tuned legal models but uses GPT-4o for drafting and Claude for analysis.

### The Fine-Tuning Layer

Foundation models provide general intelligence. **Fine-tuning specializes them for specific domains.**

**Fine-tuning process**:

1. **Collect domain-specific data**
   - Legal: 10,000+ annotated contracts, case law, legal briefs
   - Accounting: 50,000+ financial statements, audit reports
   - Medical: 100,000+ patient records, medical literature

2. **Create training examples**
   - Input: "Review this Series B term sheet for red flags"
   - Expected output: "Three concerning clauses: (1) Full ratchet anti-dilution..."

3. **Fine-tune the model**
   - Start with foundation model (GPT-4o, Claude)
   - Train on domain data for 10-100 hours
   - Cost: $10,000-$100,000 per domain

4. **Evaluate performance**
   - Compare to human experts on test cases
   - Measure: accuracy, speed, cost
   - Target: 90%+ expert parity

**Example**: Harvey AI fine-tuned GPT-4 on 1 million+ legal documents. The result:
- Legal research: 98% accuracy vs. 97% for junior associates
- Contract review: 12 minutes vs. 6 hours for humans
- Cost: $50 vs. $2,100 for human billable hours

### The Specialized Model Landscape

Beyond the Big Three, specialized models target specific professional services:

**Coding**:
- **GitHub Copilot** (based on OpenAI Codex): Code generation, bug fixing
- **Cursor** (Claude-based): AI pair programming
- **Replit Agent** (GPT-4o): Full-stack application building

**Legal**:
- **Harvey AI** (GPT-4 fine-tuned): Legal research, contract drafting
- **LawGeex** (proprietary): Contract review and risk assessment
- **Ironclad** (proprietary): Contract lifecycle management

**Accounting**:
- **Pilot** (proprietary): Bookkeeping automation
- **Bench** (proprietary): Real-time financial reporting
- **Puzzle** (GPT-4-based): Cash flow forecasting

**Medical**:
- **Nuance Dragon Medical** (proprietary): Clinical documentation
- **IBM Watson Health** (proprietary): Diagnosis assistance
- **Google Med-PaLM 2** (PaLM-based): Medical question answering

## Layer 2: Knowledge Systems

Foundation models have general intelligence but lack specific knowledge. **Knowledge systems provide the context AI agents need to perform professional work.**

### RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation

RAG is the architectural pattern that makes AI agents knowledgeable.

**The problem RAG solves**:

Traditional AI training bakes knowledge into model weights. This has three issues:
1. **Expensive**: Training costs millions of dollars
2. **Static**: Knowledge becomes outdated quickly
3. **Opaque**: Hard to verify where knowledge comes from

RAG separates knowledge from reasoning:
- **Knowledge**: Stored in external databases (constantly updated)
- **Reasoning**: Provided by foundation models (general intelligence)

**RAG architecture**:

```yaml
# RAG Pipeline for Legal Research

1. Document Ingestion:
   - Input: Legal documents (contracts, case law, statutes)
   - Process: Chunk into paragraphs, extract metadata
   - Store: Vector database with embeddings

2. Query Processing:
   - Input: "What are standard anti-dilution provisions?"
   - Embed: Convert query to 1536-dimensional vector
   - Search: Find 10 most relevant document chunks

3. Context Assembly:
   - Retrieve: Top 10 chunks (5,000-10,000 words)
   - Format: Combine into structured prompt
   - Metadata: Include document source, date, jurisdiction

4. Generation:
   - Send: Context + Query to GPT-4o
   - Generate: Answer with citations
   - Validate: Check citations against source documents

5. Response:
   - Output: "Standard anti-dilution provisions include:
              1. Full ratchet (rare, investor-favorable)
              2. Weighted average (common, balanced)
              Source: Series B Term Sheet Template, NVCA 2024"
```

**Real-world implementation** (Harvey AI legal research):

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from pinecone import Pinecone

# Initialize services
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="...")
pinecone_client = Pinecone(api_key="...")
index = pinecone_client.Index("legal-knowledge")

def legal_research(question: str) -> dict:
    # Step 1: Embed the question
    embedding = openai_client.embeddings.create(
        model="text-embedding-3-large",
        input=question
    ).data[0].embedding

    # Step 2: Search vector database
    results = index.query(
        vector=embedding,
        top_k=10,
        include_metadata=True
    )

    # Step 3: Assemble context from retrieved documents
    context = "\n\n".join([
        f"[Document {i+1}] {match.metadata['text']}\n"
        f"Source: {match.metadata['source']}"
        for i, match in enumerate(results.matches)
    ])

    # Step 4: Generate answer with GPT-4o
    completion = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a legal research assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"""
                Question: {question}

                Relevant legal precedents and documents:
                {context}

                Provide a detailed answer with citations.
            """}
        ]
    )

    return {
        "answer": completion.choices[0].message.content,
        "sources": [m.metadata['source'] for m in results.matches],
        "cost": estimate_cost(embedding, completion)
    }

# Usage
result = legal_research("What are market-standard vesting terms for founders?")
print(result["answer"])
# Output: "Standard founder vesting is 4 years with 1-year cliff:
#          - 25% vests after 1 year (cliff)
#          - Remaining 75% vests monthly over 36 months
#          Source: Y Combinator Safe Agreement, 2024"
```

**Cost comparison**:
- **Traditional legal research**: $350/hour × 4 hours = $1,400
- **RAG-powered AI**: $0.05 (embedding) + $0.20 (generation) = $0.25
- **Cost reduction**: 5,600x cheaper

### Vector Databases

Vector databases are the storage layer for RAG systems. They store embeddings—high-dimensional numerical representations of text, images, and other data.

**How embeddings work**:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

# Convert text to 1536-dimensional vector
text = "Standard anti-dilution provisions protect investors from dilution."
embedding = client.embeddings.create(
    model="text-embedding-3-large",
    input=text
).data[0].embedding

# Result: [0.012, -0.031, 0.045, ..., 0.007]  # 1536 numbers
# Similar texts have similar embeddings (measured by cosine similarity)
```

**Semantic search example**:

```python
# Query: "What protects investors from dilution?"
query_embedding = embed("What protects investors from dilution?")

# Find documents with similar embeddings
results = vector_db.search(query_embedding, top_k=5)

# Results include:
# 1. "Anti-dilution provisions protect investors..." (0.92 similarity)
# 2. "Full ratchet prevents dilution in down rounds..." (0.89 similarity)
# 3. "Weighted average anti-dilution..." (0.87 similarity)
```

**The magic**: Even though the query doesn't mention "anti-dilution," semantic search finds relevant documents based on **meaning**, not keywords.

**Popular vector databases**:

**Pinecone** (managed service):
- **Use case**: Production RAG systems, high-scale
- **Pricing**: $70/month for 100K vectors, $0.096 per GB/month
- **Features**: Real-time indexing, metadata filtering, hybrid search

**Weaviate** (open-source + managed):
- **Use case**: Custom RAG, on-premises deployment
- **Pricing**: Free (self-hosted), $25/month managed
- **Features**: GraphQL API, multi-tenancy, modules for various models

**Chroma** (open-source):
- **Use case**: Prototyping, local development
- **Pricing**: Free (self-hosted)
- **Features**: Simple Python API, works with LangChain

**Qdrant** (open-source + managed):
- **Use case**: High-performance RAG, real-time search
- **Pricing**: Free (self-hosted), $50/month managed
- **Features**: Rust-based performance, advanced filtering

### Knowledge Graph Integration

Vector databases excel at semantic search, but **knowledge graphs** provide structured relationships.

**Example**: Legal knowledge graph

```yaml
# Nodes (Entities)
- id: term_sheet_001
  type: Document
  title: "Series B Term Sheet"
  date: "2024-03-15"

- id: anti_dilution_001
  type: Clause
  name: "Weighted Average Anti-Dilution"
  category: "Investor Protection"

- id: investor_001
  type: Party
  name: "Sequoia Capital"
  role: "Lead Investor"

# Edges (Relationships)
- from: term_sheet_001
  to: anti_dilution_001
  relationship: CONTAINS

- from: anti_dilution_001
  to: investor_001
  relationship: BENEFITS

- from: anti_dilution_001
  to: weighted_average_formula
  relationship: REFERENCES
```

**Query knowledge graph**:

```graphql
query {
  clauses(type: "Investor Protection") {
    name
    documents {
      title
      date
    }
    beneficiaries {
      name
      role
    }
  }
}
```

**Result**:

```json
{
  "clauses": [
    {
      "name": "Weighted Average Anti-Dilution",
      "documents": [
        {"title": "Series B Term Sheet", "date": "2024-03-15"}
      ],
      "beneficiaries": [
        {"name": "Sequoia Capital", "role": "Lead Investor"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Hybrid approach**: Services-as-Software platforms combine:
- **Vector search** for semantic retrieval ("find documents about dilution protection")
- **Knowledge graphs** for structured queries ("show me all clauses that benefit investors")

## Layer 3: Agent Orchestration

Individual AI models are powerful. **Multi-agent systems are transformative.**

### What Are AI Agents?

An AI agent is software that:
1. **Perceives** its environment (reads data, receives inputs)
2. **Reasons** about actions (decides what to do)
3. **Acts** autonomously (executes tasks without human intervention)
4. **Learns** from feedback (improves over time)

**Simple agent**:

```python
class LegalResearchAgent:
    def perceive(self, query: str):
        """Understand the research question"""
        self.query = query
        self.intent = classify_intent(query)  # "case_law" | "statute" | "precedent"

    def reason(self):
        """Decide which databases to search"""
        if self.intent == "case_law":
            self.databases = ["westlaw", "lexis_nexis"]
        elif self.intent == "statute":
            self.databases = ["us_code", "state_statutes"]
        else:
            self.databases = ["westlaw", "lexis_nexis", "legal_blogs"]

    def act(self):
        """Execute the research"""
        results = []
        for db in self.databases:
            results.extend(search_database(db, self.query))
        return synthesize_answer(results)

    def learn(self, feedback: dict):
        """Improve based on user feedback"""
        if feedback["helpful"]:
            update_search_weights(self.databases, increase=True)
        else:
            update_search_weights(self.databases, decrease=True)
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination

Real professional work requires **multiple specialized agents working together**.

**Example**: Contract review workflow

```yaml
# Multi-Agent Contract Review System

Agents:
  - name: intake_agent
    role: "Receive and classify contracts"
    capabilities: [document_parsing, classification]

  - name: risk_agent
    role: "Identify legal risks"
    capabilities: [risk_assessment, precedent_search]

  - name: compliance_agent
    role: "Check regulatory compliance"
    capabilities: [regulation_search, compliance_validation]

  - name: negotiation_agent
    role: "Suggest redlines and alternatives"
    capabilities: [clause_generation, precedent_matching]

  - name: summary_agent
    role: "Generate executive summary"
    capabilities: [summarization, key_points_extraction]

Workflow:
  1. intake_agent:
       input: contract_pdf
       output: {type: "MSA", parties: ["Acme Corp", "Client Inc"], clauses: [...]}
       next: [risk_agent, compliance_agent]

  2. risk_agent + compliance_agent (parallel):
       input: parsed_contract
       output:
         risk_agent: {high_risk: ["unlimited liability clause"], ...}
         compliance_agent: {violations: ["missing GDPR clause"], ...}
       next: negotiation_agent

  3. negotiation_agent:
       input: risks + compliance_issues
       output: {redlines: [...], alternative_clauses: [...]}
       next: summary_agent

  4. summary_agent:
       input: original_contract + risks + redlines
       output: executive_summary
       next: human_review
```

**Implementation** (using LangChain):

```python
from langchain.agents import Agent, AgentExecutor
from langchain.tools import Tool

# Define specialized agents
risk_agent = Agent(
    name="Risk Assessor",
    llm=gpt4o,
    tools=[
        Tool(name="search_case_law", func=search_legal_precedents),
        Tool(name="analyze_clause", func=analyze_legal_clause)
    ],
    prompt="You identify legal risks in contracts."
)

compliance_agent = Agent(
    name="Compliance Checker",
    llm=claude35,
    tools=[
        Tool(name="check_gdpr", func=check_gdpr_compliance),
        Tool(name="check_ccpa", func=check_ccpa_compliance)
    ],
    prompt="You verify regulatory compliance."
)

negotiation_agent = Agent(
    name="Negotiation Strategist",
    llm=gpt4o,
    tools=[
        Tool(name="draft_alternative", func=draft_alternative_clause),
        Tool(name="find_precedent", func=find_precedent_clause)
    ],
    prompt="You suggest contract improvements."
)

# Orchestrate workflow
async def review_contract(contract_pdf: bytes) -> dict:
    # Step 1: Parse contract
    parsed = await intake_agent.parse(contract_pdf)

    # Step 2: Parallel risk + compliance analysis
    risk_results, compliance_results = await asyncio.gather(
        risk_agent.analyze(parsed),
        compliance_agent.verify(parsed)
    )

    # Step 3: Generate negotiation suggestions
    suggestions = await negotiation_agent.suggest(
        contract=parsed,
        risks=risk_results,
        compliance=compliance_results
    )

    # Step 4: Executive summary
    summary = await summary_agent.summarize(
        contract=parsed,
        risks=risk_results,
        compliance=compliance_results,
        suggestions=suggestions
    )

    return {
        "summary": summary,
        "risks": risk_results,
        "compliance": compliance_results,
        "suggestions": suggestions,
        "time": "18 minutes",
        "cost": "$12"
    }

# Traditional human process: 8-12 hours, $2,800-$4,200
# AI agent system: 18 minutes, $12
# Improvement: 27-40x faster, 233-350x cheaper
```

### Agent Frameworks

Building multi-agent systems from scratch is complex. **Agent frameworks provide abstractions and patterns.**

**LangChain**:
- **Purpose**: General-purpose agent orchestration
- **Strengths**: Large ecosystem, many integrations, active community
- **Use cases**: RAG systems, chatbots, document processing

**LlamaIndex**:
- **Purpose**: Data-centric agent systems
- **Strengths**: Advanced RAG, data connectors, query engines
- **Use cases**: Knowledge management, enterprise search

**AutoGPT**:
- **Purpose**: Autonomous goal-driven agents
- **Strengths**: Self-directed planning, long-running tasks
- **Use cases**: Research automation, content generation

**CrewAI**:
- **Purpose**: Role-based multi-agent collaboration
- **Strengths**: Agent roles, tasks, sequential/parallel workflows
- **Use cases**: Business process automation, professional services

**Example** (CrewAI for contract review):

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Define agents with roles
risk_analyst = Agent(
    role="Legal Risk Analyst",
    goal="Identify all legal risks in contracts",
    backstory="Expert in contract law with 15 years experience",
    llm=gpt4o
)

compliance_officer = Agent(
    role="Compliance Officer",
    goal="Ensure contracts comply with regulations",
    backstory="Specialized in GDPR, CCPA, and SOC 2 compliance",
    llm=claude35
)

negotiator = Agent(
    role="Contract Negotiator",
    goal="Improve contract terms for client benefit",
    backstory="Skilled at finding win-win solutions",
    llm=gpt4o
)

# Define tasks
analyze_risks = Task(
    description="Analyze this contract for legal risks: {contract}",
    agent=risk_analyst
)

check_compliance = Task(
    description="Verify regulatory compliance: {contract}",
    agent=compliance_officer
)

suggest_improvements = Task(
    description="Suggest contract improvements based on risks: {risks} and compliance: {compliance}",
    agent=negotiator,
    context=[analyze_risks, check_compliance]  # Depends on previous tasks
)

# Create crew (orchestrates agents and tasks)
contract_crew = Crew(
    agents=[risk_analyst, compliance_officer, negotiator],
    tasks=[analyze_risks, check_compliance, suggest_improvements],
    verbose=True
)

# Execute
result = contract_crew.kickoff(inputs={"contract": contract_text})
```

**Output**:

```
[Risk Analyst] Analyzing contract for legal risks...
[Risk Analyst] Found 3 high-priority risks:
  1. Unlimited liability clause (Section 8.2)
  2. Auto-renewal without notice (Section 12.1)
  3. Unilateral termination rights (Section 14.3)

[Compliance Officer] Checking regulatory compliance...
[Compliance Officer] Found 2 compliance issues:
  1. Missing GDPR data processing addendum
  2. Inadequate data breach notification clause

[Negotiator] Suggesting contract improvements...
[Negotiator] Recommendations:
  1. Cap liability at 12 months fees ($500K)
  2. Require 90-day notice before auto-renewal
  3. Add mutual termination for convenience (90 days)
  4. Include standard GDPR DPA
  5. Add 72-hour breach notification requirement

Result: Contract improvements drafted in 16 minutes
```

### The Integration Layer

Domain expertise requires **integration with existing professional tools**:

**Legal Services Integrations**:

```python
# Harvey AI integration example

## Layer 5: Business Logic

The top layer of the Services-as-Software stack is **Business-as-Code**—YAML specifications that define how services operate.

### Business-as-Code Integration

In the companion book *Business-as-Code*, we detailed how businesses can be specified as code. Services-as-Software is the **execution layer** for those specifications.

**Example**: Legal service defined as Business-as-Code

```yaml
# legal-research-service.yaml

service:
  name: Legal Research Service
  type: services.LegalResearch
  version: "1.0.0"

agents:
  - name: intake_agent
    type: agents.DocumentClassifier
    capabilities: [pdf_parsing, entity_extraction]

  - name: research_agent
    type: agents.LegalResearcher
    knowledge_bases:
      - westlaw
      - lexis_nexis
      - case_law_archive
    model: gpt-4o-legal (fine-tuned)

  - name: synthesis_agent
    type: agents.AnswerSynthesizer
    model: claude-3.5-sonnet
    output_format: legal_memo

workflows:
  research_query:
    steps:
      - agent: intake_agent
        action: classify_query
        input: ${query}
        output: classification

      - agent: research_agent
        action: search_legal_databases
        input:
          query: ${query}
          jurisdiction: ${classification.jurisdiction}
          practice_area: ${classification.practice_area}
        output: raw_results

      - agent: synthesis_agent
        action: synthesize_answer
        input:
          query: ${query}
          results: ${raw_results}
        output: final_answer

integrations:
  - name: westlaw
    type: integrations.Westlaw
    api_key: ${secrets.WESTLAW_API_KEY}

  - name: lexis_nexis
    type: integrations.LexisNexis
    api_key: ${secrets.LEXIS_API_KEY}

pricing:
  model: subscription
  tiers:
    - name: Professional
      price: $99/month
      limits:
        queries_per_month: 100

    - name: Firm
      price: $499/month
      limits:
        queries_per_month: unlimited
        users: 10

monitoring:
  metrics:
    - name: response_time_p95
      target: "< 2 minutes"

    - name: accuracy
      target: "> 95% vs. expert baseline"

    - name: customer_satisfaction
      target: "> 4.5/5.0"
```

**Execution**: This YAML specification is deployed to a Services-as-Software runtime that:

1. **Provisions resources**: Foundation models, vector databases, knowledge bases
2. **Configures agents**: Loads capabilities, connects to integrations
3. **Orchestrates workflows**: Routes queries through agent pipeline
4. **Monitors performance**: Tracks metrics, alerts on issues
5. **Handles billing**: Tracks usage, enforces limits, processes payments

### The Services-as-Software Runtime

Just as Kubernetes orchestrates containers, **Services-as-Software runtimes orchestrate AI agents**.

**Architecture**:

```yaml
# Services-as-Software Runtime Architecture

Layers:
  1. Infrastructure:
       - Foundation models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google APIs)
       - Vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate)
       - Message queues (SQS, RabbitMQ)
       - Blob storage (S3, R2)

  2. Agent Runtime:
       - Agent lifecycle management (start, stop, scale)
       - Multi-agent coordination (sequential, parallel, conditional)
       - State management (conversation history, context)
       - Error handling (retries, fallbacks, escalation)

  3. Workflow Engine:
       - YAML specification parser
       - Directed acyclic graph (DAG) execution
       - Conditional logic (if/else, loops)
       - Human-in-the-loop checkpoints

  4. Integration Layer:
       - 500+ pre-built connectors (Salesforce, Stripe, etc.)
       - OAuth authentication
       - Rate limiting and quotas
       - Webhook handling

  5. Observability:
       - Logging (agent actions, decisions, outputs)
       - Metrics (latency, cost, accuracy)
       - Tracing (request flow through agents)
       - Alerting (failures, degraded performance)
```

**Example runtime** (simplified):

```python
class ServicesAsCodeRuntime:
    def __init__(self, spec: dict):
        self.spec = spec
        self.agents = self._load_agents(spec["agents"])
        self.workflows = self._load_workflows(spec["workflows"])
        self.integrations = self._load_integrations(spec["integrations"])

    async def execute_workflow(self, workflow_name: str, inputs: dict) -> dict:
        workflow = self.workflows[workflow_name]
        context = {"inputs": inputs, "outputs": {}}

        for step in workflow["steps"]:
            agent = self.agents[step["agent"]]
            action = step["action"]

            # Resolve input variables
            step_input = self._resolve_vars(step["input"], context)

            # Execute agent action
            result = await agent.execute(action, step_input)

            # Store output
            context["outputs"][step["output"]] = result

            # Log execution
            await self._log_step(step, result)

        return context["outputs"]["final_answer"]

    def _resolve_vars(self, template: any, context: dict) -> any:
        """Resolve ${variable} references in templates"""
        if isinstance(template, str) and template.startswith("${"):
            var_path = template[2:-1]  # Remove ${ and }
            return self._get_nested(context, var_path)
        elif isinstance(template, dict):
            return {k: self._resolve_vars(v, context) for k, v in template.items()}
        else:
            return template
```

## The Complete Stack in Action

Let's see how all five layers work together in a real Services-as-Software application.

**Scenario**: A startup needs to review a vendor contract.

**Step-by-step execution**:

**1. User submits contract** (via web interface):

```javascript
// Frontend
const response = await fetch('https://api.harvey.ai/contracts/review', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`},
  body: JSON.stringify({
    contract_pdf: base64_pdf,
    review_type: 'vendor_agreement',
    jurisdiction: 'delaware'
  })
})
```

**2. Layer 5: Business Logic** routes to appropriate workflow:

```yaml
# Contract review workflow (defined in Business-as-Code YAML)
workflow: vendor_agreement_review
agents: [intake, risk_assessment, compliance_check, negotiation_strategy]
```

**3. Layer 4: Domain Expertise** activates specialized legal agents:

```python
# Harvey AI legal agents activated
intake_agent = HarveyIntakeAgent(model="gpt-4o-legal")
risk_agent = HarveyRiskAgent(model="gpt-4o-legal", knowledge_base="vendor_risks")
compliance_agent = HarveyComplianceAgent(model="claude-3.5-legal")
negotiation_agent = HarveyNegotiationAgent(model="gpt-4o-legal")
```

**4. Layer 3: Agent Orchestration** coordinates the workflow:

```python
# Multi-agent coordination
parsed_contract = await intake_agent.parse(contract_pdf)

# Parallel execution of risk and compliance
risks, compliance = await asyncio.gather(
    risk_agent.analyze(parsed_contract),
    compliance_agent.verify(parsed_contract, jurisdiction="delaware")
)

# Sequential execution of negotiation strategy
strategy = await negotiation_agent.develop_strategy(
    contract=parsed_contract,
    risks=risks,
    compliance=compliance
)
```

**5. Layer 2: Knowledge Systems** provide context via RAG:

```python
# Risk agent uses RAG to find similar contracts
similar_contracts = vector_db.search(
    embedding=embed(parsed_contract.summary),
    filter={"type": "vendor_agreement", "jurisdiction": "delaware"},
    top_k=10
)

# Compliance agent searches regulations
relevant_regulations = vector_db.search(
    embedding=embed("delaware vendor agreement requirements"),
    knowledge_base="legal_regulations",
    top_k=5
)
```

**6. Layer 1: Foundation Models** perform reasoning:

```python
# GPT-4o analyzes risks
risk_analysis = await openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-11-20",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a legal risk analyst."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"""
            Contract: {parsed_contract}
            Similar contracts: {similar_contracts}
            Identify risks and rate severity (high/medium/low).
        """}
    ]
)

# Claude 3.5 checks compliance
compliance_check = await anthropic.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": f"""
            Contract: {parsed_contract}
            Delaware regulations: {relevant_regulations}
            Verify compliance and flag any violations.
        """}
    ]
)
```

**7. Response to user** (complete analysis in 12 minutes):

```json
{
  "summary": "Reviewed vendor agreement (24 pages) for compliance and risks.",
  "risks": [
    {
      "severity": "high",
      "clause": "Section 8.2: Unlimited Liability",
      "description": "No cap on vendor's liability exposure.",
      "recommendation": "Negotiate cap at 12 months fees or $500K, whichever is greater."
    },
    {
      "severity": "medium",
      "clause": "Section 12.1: Auto-Renewal",
      "description": "Automatically renews without notice.",
      "recommendation": "Require 90-day written notice before renewal."
    }
  ],
  "compliance": {
    "status": "violations_found",
    "issues": [
      {
        "regulation": "Delaware Data Privacy Law",
        "violation": "Missing data breach notification clause (required 72 hours)",
        "recommendation": "Add Section 15.4: Data Breach Notification"
      }
    ]
  },
  "negotiation_strategy": {
    "priority_items": [
      "Cap liability (critical)",
      "Add breach notification (legally required)",
      "Change auto-renewal terms (important)"
    ],
    "alternative_clauses": [...],
    "redlines": "https://harvey.ai/redlines/abc123.pdf"
  },
  "time": "12 minutes",
  "cost": "$15.50"
}
```

**Traditional process**:
- Time: 6-8 hours (associate review)
- Cost: $2,100-$2,800 (billable hours)
- Delivery: 2-3 business days

**Services-as-Software process**:
- Time: 12 minutes
- Cost: $15.50
- Delivery: Real-time

**Improvement**: 30-40x faster, 135-180x cheaper, same quality

## The Economics of the Stack

Each layer has distinct economics that combine to create Services-as-Software unit economics.

### Cost Breakdown

**Example**: Legal research query

```yaml
Layer 1 - Foundation Models:
  Input tokens: 10,000 (contract + query + context)
  Output tokens: 2,000 (analysis + citations)
  Cost: (10K × $0.0025) + (2K × $0.01) = $0.025 + $0.02 = $0.045

Layer 2 - Knowledge Systems:
  Vector search: 5 queries × $0.001 = $0.005
  Storage: 100 MB contract × $0.0001 = $0.00001
  Cost: $0.00501

Layer 3 - Agent Orchestration:
  Compute: 2 minutes × $0.05/hour = $0.0017
  State management: Negligible
  Cost: $0.0017

Layer 4 - Domain Expertise:
  Fine-tuned model overhead: 20% × $0.045 = $0.009
  Integration API calls: 3 × $0.01 = $0.03
  Cost: $0.039

Layer 5 - Business Logic:
  Workflow execution: $0.001
  Monitoring/logging: $0.001
  Cost: $0.002

Total Cost per Query: $0.093 (≈ $0.10)
```

**Traditional cost**: $350/hour × 0.5 hours = $175

**Cost reduction**: 1,750x cheaper

### Scaling Economics

Services-as-Software exhibits **exponential cost curves** (costs decrease as volume increases):

**1-10 queries/month**:
- Cost per query: $0.50 (infrastructure overhead dominates)

**100-1,000 queries/month**:
- Cost per query: $0.20 (amortized infrastructure)

**10,000-100,000 queries/month**:
- Cost per query: $0.10 (volume discounts on APIs)

**1M+ queries/month**:
- Cost per query: $0.05 (enterprise pricing, custom models)

**Result**: High-volume customers are 10x cheaper to serve than low-volume customers.

### Margin Structure

**Traditional professional services** (law firm):

```yaml
Revenue: $1,000 (associate bills 4 hours × $250/hour)
Costs:
  - Salary: $300 (4 hours of $150K/year fully-loaded)
  - Overhead: $200 (office, admin, partners)
Margin: $500 (50% gross margin)
```

**Services-as-Software** (Harvey AI):

```yaml
Revenue: $1,000 (100 queries × $10 subscription / 100 queries)
Costs:
  - Foundation models: $10 (100 queries × $0.10)
  - Infrastructure: $5 (vector DB, storage, compute)
  - Engineers: $50 (amortized R&D across millions of queries)
Margin: $935 (93.5% gross margin)
```

**Why Services-as-Software margins are higher**:
1. **No human labor costs** (largest expense in traditional services)
2. **Non-linear scaling** (2x customers ≠ 2x costs)
3. **Zero marginal cost** for software (once built, incremental queries are nearly free)

---

## Building on the Stack

For entrepreneurs and developers, the Services-as-Software stack provides **building blocks** for new businesses.

### Example: Building "TaxGPT"

Let's walk through building a Services-as-Software business from scratch.

**Product**: AI-powered tax preparation for freelancers and small businesses.

**Step 1: Choose your foundation** (Layer 1)

```python
# Use GPT-4o for general reasoning
from openai import OpenAI
openai_client = OpenAI()

# Use Claude for financial analysis (better at numbers)
from anthropic import Anthropic
anthropic_client = Anthropic()
```

**Cost**: $0 (pay per use)

**Step 2: Build knowledge system** (Layer 2)

```python
# Ingest IRS documents, tax code, and guides
from pinecone import Pinecone

pinecone = Pinecone(api_key="...")
index = pinecone.create_index(
    name="tax-knowledge",
    dimension=1536,
    metric="cosine"
)

# Embed and store tax documents
documents = load_irs_documents()  # 10,000+ pages
for doc in documents:
    embedding = openai_client.embeddings.create(
        model="text-embedding-3-large",
        input=doc.text
    ).data[0].embedding

    index.upsert([(doc.id, embedding, doc.metadata)])
```

**Cost**: Pinecone free tier (100K vectors), embeddings: $20

**Step 3: Build agents** (Layer 3)

```python
from langchain.agents import Agent

# Income classification agent
income_agent = Agent(
    role="Income Classifier",
    goal="Classify income as W-2, 1099, business, investment, etc.",
    llm=openai_client
)

# Deduction agent
deduction_agent = Agent(
    role="Deduction Finder",
    goal="Identify all eligible tax deductions",
    llm=anthropic_client
)

# Tax calculation agent
calculation_agent = Agent(
    role="Tax Calculator",
    goal="Calculate federal and state tax liability",
    llm=openai_client
)
```

**Cost**: $0 (use open-source LangChain)

**Step 4: Add domain expertise** (Layer 4)

```python
# Integrate with accounting software
from plaid import PlaidAPI
plaid = PlaidAPI(client_id="...", secret="...")

# Connect to bank accounts
def sync_transactions():
    accounts = plaid.get_accounts()
    transactions = []
    for account in accounts:
        txns = plaid.get_transactions(account.id)
        transactions.extend(txns)
    return transactions

# Integrate with IRS e-file
from irs_efile import IRS_API
irs = IRS_API(api_key="...")

def file_return(tax_return: dict):
    return irs.efile(tax_return)
```

**Cost**: Plaid $0.25/user/month, IRS e-file $5/return

**Step 5: Define business logic** (Layer 5)

```yaml
# taxgpt-service.yaml

service:
  name: TaxGPT
  type: services.TaxPreparation

agents:
  - name: income_classifier
    type: agents.IncomeClassifier
  - name: deduction_finder
    type: agents.DeductionFinder
  - name: tax_calculator
    type: agents.TaxCalculator

workflows:
  prepare_tax_return:
    steps:
      - agent: income_classifier
        action: classify_income
        input: ${transactions}

      - agent: deduction_finder
        action: find_deductions
        input: ${transactions}

      - agent: tax_calculator
        action: calculate_taxes
        input:
          income: ${income_classifier.output}
          deductions: ${deduction_finder.output}

      - action: generate_1040
        input: ${tax_calculator.output}

pricing:
  model: per_return
  tiers:
    - name: Simple
      price: $49
      includes: [federal_return]

    - name: Premium
      price: $99
      includes: [federal_return, state_return, audit_protection]
```

**Step 6: Deploy and scale**

```bash
# Deploy to Cloudflare Workers (serverless)
wrangler deploy

# Cost: $0 for up to 100K requests/day
# Scales automatically to millions of users
```

**Total startup cost**: ~$1,000
**Monthly operating cost** (1,000 users): ~$300
**Revenue** (1,000 users × $49 avg): $49,000
**Gross margin**: 99.4%

**Traditional tax prep business**:
- Startup cost: $100K+ (hiring CPAs, office space)
- Monthly operating cost (1,000 users): $50,000 (CPA salaries)
- Revenue: $49,000
- Gross margin: -2% (unprofitable at this scale)

## The Future of the Stack

The Services-as-Software stack is evolving rapidly. Here's what's coming:

### Trend 1: Multimodal Foundation Models

**Current**: Foundation models handle text and images.

**Future** (2025-2026): Models will handle text, images, video, audio, code, and sensor data natively.

**Impact**: Services that require multimodal reasoning (video analysis, voice interfaces, real-time sensor data) become automatable.

**Example**: Medical diagnosis from doctor's verbal notes + patient video + lab results + medical imaging—all processed by a single multimodal model.

### Trend 2: Personal AI Agents

**Current**: AI agents are provided by companies (Harvey AI, Pilot, GitHub Copilot).

**Future** (2026-2027): Everyone has a personal AI agent that learns their preferences, integrates with their tools, and acts on their behalf.

**Impact**: Professional services become **agent-to-agent** transactions.

**Example**:
- Your personal agent: "My user needs a vendor contract reviewed."
- Legal AI agent: "I'll review it. What's your user's risk tolerance?"
- Your agent: "Low risk. They prefer conservative terms."
- Legal agent: "Here's my analysis with recommended redlines."

### Trend 3: Autonomous Businesses

**Current**: AI agents automate tasks within businesses.

**Future** (2027-2030): AI agents run entire businesses autonomously.

**Impact**: Business-as-Code specifications become the primary way to launch businesses. Entrepreneurs define what they want in YAML, AI agents execute everything.

**Example**: The companion book *Business-as-Code* details this future in depth.

### Trend 4: Specialized Hardware

**Current**: Foundation models run on GPUs (NVIDIA H100, etc.).

**Future** (2025-2028): Purpose-built AI chips (Google TPU v6, AWS Trainium, Groq LPU) reduce inference costs by 10-100x.

**Impact**: Services-as-Software becomes 10-100x cheaper, enabling massive expansion to underserved markets.

**Example**: Legal research drops from $10/query to $0.10/query, making it affordable in developing countries.

### Trend 5: Regulatory Frameworks

**Current**: AI regulation is nascent (EU AI Act, Biden executive orders).

**Future** (2025-2030): Comprehensive regulations emerge for AI agents in professional services.

**Impact**: Licensed AI agents (similar to licensed professionals), liability frameworks, audit requirements.

**Example**: "Certified Legal AI Agent" requires passing bar exam equivalent, annual audits, malpractice insurance.

## Conclusion: The Stack Enables the Revolution

The Services-as-Software stack is the **technical foundation** for the $4.6 trillion professional services transformation.

**Five layers working together**:

1. **Foundation Models**: Reasoning substrate (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini)
2. **Knowledge Systems**: Context via RAG and vector databases
3. **Agent Orchestration**: Multi-agent coordination and workflows
4. **Domain Expertise**: Specialized knowledge and integrations
5. **Business Logic**: Business-as-Code specifications and runtime

**The pattern repeats**:

- Infrastructure-as-Code → Software-as-a-Service
- Business-as-Code → Services-as-Software

Just as IaC abstracted infrastructure into layers (physical → virtual → API → orchestration), Business-as-Code abstracts professional services into layers (models → knowledge → agents → domain → logic).

**The result**: 90-98% cost reduction, 10-100x speed improvement, and democratized access to expertise.

**In Part II**, we'll examine how this stack is transforming six major professional service categories: legal, accounting, IT, consulting, support, and creative services.

Each chapter will detail:
- Traditional service economics (cost, time, quality)
- Services-as-Software alternatives (products, case studies, results)
- Implementation guides (how to adopt AI agents)
- What remains human (and why)

**The stack is ready. The transformation has begun.**
