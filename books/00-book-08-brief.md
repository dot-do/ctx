## Brief

**Full Title**: Building Services-as-Software: A Practical Guide for Non-Technical Builders

## Core Premise

Professional expertise can be encoded as software, and domain experts are best positioned to build Services-as-Software products. Using accessible tools (especially SDK.do), you can automate professional services without traditional coding. This book shows you how.

**Not**: "Hire developers to build this" (misses the point—domain expertise is the moat)
**Not**: "Simple automation only" (dismissive—this enables real professional work)
**Is**: "Here's how to turn your professional expertise into automated services"

## Key Questions Answered

1. Can I really automate professional services without coding?
2. How do I encode my expertise as software?
3. What tools do I use? (SDK.do focus)
4. How do I ensure quality matches human professional work?
5. How do I handle edge cases and exceptions?
6. When do I keep humans in the loop vs. full automation?
7. How do I build trust with clients?
8. How do I price and deliver my Services-as-Software product?

## Key Themes

### 1. Domain Expertise is the Moat
Developers can build tech. Only you understand the professional domain deeply enough to automate it well.

### 2. Quality Matches or Exceeds Human
With proper design, automated services achieve professional-grade quality. Examples: 99.2% accuracy (Pilot.com), 4.6/5.0 satisfaction (Intercom Fin).

### 3. Start Narrow, Expand Later
Don't try to automate your entire profession. Pick one high-value workflow. Perfect it. Then expand.

### 4. Hybrid is Often Best
Full automation for routine cases. Human escalation for complex cases. Best of both worlds.

### 5. You're Building a Product, Not Just Automation
Packaging, UX, support, trust-building matter as much as the automation itself.

## Differentiation from Other Books

**Book 2 (Services-as-Software)**: Why professional services are being automated
**Book 7 (Building BaC)**: General business automation
**Book 8 (This book)**: Professional services automation specifically (non-technical)
