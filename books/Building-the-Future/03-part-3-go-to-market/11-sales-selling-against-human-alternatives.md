# Chapter 11: Sales: Selling Against Human Alternatives

In 2023, a legal AI startup with 92% accuracy on contract review benchmarks struggled to close deals.

Their pitch: "Our AI is as accurate as junior associates, 10x faster, and 90% cheaper."

**Customer response**: "That sounds great, but what if it makes a mistake? Our attorneys have malpractice insurance and bar licenses. What do you have?"

The startup had built a technically superior product but hadn't addressed the fundamental sales challenge for Services-as-Software: **You're not competing on features. You're competing on trust.**

This chapter teaches you how to sell Services-as-Software by overcoming the trust barrier.

## Why Selling SaS is Different from Selling SaaS

### Traditional SaaS Sales

**Value proposition**: "Our software helps you do X faster/better"

**Buyer concern**: "Will this software work? Does it have the features I need?"

**Proof required**: Demo, free trial, case studies

**Decision maker**: Department head (VP Marketing, VP Sales, etc.)

**Sales cycle**: 1-3 months

**Close rate**: 15-25% from demo to close

### Services-as-Software Sales

**Value proposition**: "Replace expensive humans with AI that costs 1/10th as much"

**Buyer concern**: "Can I trust AI to replace our experts? What if it screws up?"

**Proof required**: Pilot with real work, side-by-side comparison to humans, risk mitigation (insurance, guarantees)

**Decision maker**: Often C-suite (replacing humans is strategic, risky)

**Sales cycle**: 2-6 months (SMB) to 6-12 months (enterprise)

**Close rate**: 5-15% from demo to close (lower due to trust barrier)

**The fundamental difference**: SaaS buyers evaluate features. SaS buyers evaluate trust.

## The Three-Stage Trust-Building Process

### Stage 1: Demonstrate (Show, Don't Tell)

**Goal**: Prove the AI actually works on customer's real work.

**Methods:**

**Method 1: Live demo with customer data**

**Instead of:** Generic demo with sample data
**Do this:** Demo on customer's actual contracts/documents/data

**Example: Harvey AI sales call**

```
Salesperson: "Can you share a recent contract you reviewed?
We'll analyze it live and compare our output to your associate's work."

[Customer shares employment agreement]

[5 minutes later]

Salesperson: "Here's our AI's analysis. It identified 7 risks:
- Non-compete clause issue (same as your associate found)
- Ambiguous IP assignment (your associate missed this)
- Missing arbitration clause (your associate flagged this)
- ...

Let's compare: Our AI found 6/7 of what your associate found,
plus 1 additional issue. Took 3 minutes vs. 2 hours."

Customer: [sees concrete evidence AI works]
```

**Why it works**: Customer sees AI perform on their real work, not curated examples.

**Method 2: Free pilot (risk-free trial)**

**Offer**: "Use our service free for 30 days on real work. Compare to your current process. If it doesn't save time/money, walk away."

**Structure:**
```
Week 1: Onboarding (train on customer workflows)
Week 2-3: Pilot (customer uses for real work)
Week 4: Results review (measure time saved, accuracy, cost reduction)
```

**Example: Pilot.com's bookkeeping pilot**

**Pilot to CFO**: "We'll categorize your last 3 months of expenses (2,000 transactions).
You don't pay anything. Your accountant reviews our work.
If accuracy is below 95%, we walk away. If accuracy is 95%+, let's discuss a paid engagement."

**Result**: 70% of pilots convert to paid (because results speak for themselves)

**Method 3: Money-back guarantee**

**Offer**: "First month money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with quality, we refund 100%."

**Why it works**: Eliminates purchase risk. Customers know they can reverse decision.

**Psychology**: <5% of customers actually ask for refunds (they're already bought in once they've started using)

**Method 4: Side-by-side bake-off**

**Offer**: "Give us and your current provider the same 10 tasks. We'll both complete them. You compare quality, speed, cost. Choose whoever performs better."

**Example: Legal AI competing with junior associates**

```
10 contracts → Both AI and junior associate review → Customer compares outputs

Results:
- AI accuracy: 89% (missed 1 clause out of 9 flagged issues)
- Associate accuracy: 92% (complete)
- AI time: 30 minutes total (3 min/contract)
- Associate time: 20 hours (2 hours/contract)
- AI cost: $500 ($50/contract)
- Associate cost: $6,000 ($300/hour × 20 hours)

Customer: "AI is 90% as accurate for 10% of the cost and 40x faster.
We can have associates review AI outputs and still save 15 hours. Let's do it."
```

**Key insight**: Don't claim superiority. Let customer judge based on evidence.

### Stage 2: De-Risk (Remove Barriers)

**Goal**: Reduce perceived risk of switching to AI.

**Risk-reversal tactics:**

**Tactic 1: Satisfaction guarantees**

```
"If you're not satisfied for any reason in the first 90 days, we'll:
1. Refund your payment
2. Help transition back to your previous solution
3. No questions asked"
```

**Tactic 2: Performance SLAs**

```
"We guarantee:
- 95%+ accuracy (measured monthly)
- <24 hour response time for all tasks
- 99.9% uptime

If we miss these SLAs, you get:
- 10% credit for each SLA violation
- Option to terminate contract penalty-free"
```

**Why it works**: Shifts risk from customer to vendor. Customer knows they're protected.

**Tactic 3: Hybrid approach (AI + Human safety net)**

```
"We don't replace your team—we augment them:
- AI handles 80-90% of routine work
- Your experts review AI outputs (10-20% of time vs. 100%)
- Experts handle edge cases and complex situations

Result: Your team becomes 5x more productive without eliminating jobs."
```

**Why it works**: Less threatening than "we're replacing your employees." Easier to get internal buy-in.

**Tactic 4: Errors & omissions insurance**

```
"We carry $5M in E&O insurance.

If our AI makes an error that causes you financial loss:
- We cover the loss (up to policy limits)
- Same protection as using a professional services firm"
```

**Why it works**: Addresses "what if AI screws up?" objection directly. Shows you stand behind quality.

**Example: Harvey AI's insurance**

Harvey carries $5M E&O policy from Beazley (major professional liability insurer).

Sales messaging: "We have the same insurance as major law firms. We're accountable just like any law firm would be."

**Tactic 5: Pilot with limited scope**

```
"Start with 10% of your work:
- Use AI for low-risk contracts (NDAs, standard employment agreements)
- Keep using humans for high-risk contracts (M&A, complex litigation)
- Expand scope after you're comfortable"
```

**Why it works**: Limits downside. Customers can test with minimal risk.

### Stage 3: Deliver (Prove Value Quickly)

**Goal**: New customer sees ROI within first 30 days.

**Onboarding for fast time-to-value:**

**Week 1: Setup and training**
- Integrate with customer systems (upload documents, connect APIs)
- Train on customer-specific requirements
- Process first batch of test tasks

**Week 2: First real tasks**
- Customer submits 10-20 real tasks
- AI completes them
- Customer reviews outputs

**Week 3: Measure results**
```
Results dashboard:
- Tasks completed: 47
- Time saved: 18 hours (vs. human baseline)
- Cost saved: $5,400 (at $300/hour attorney rate)
- Accuracy: 94% (validated by customer)

ROI in first month: 450% (saved $5,400 for $1,200 fee)
```

**Week 4: Expand usage**
- Customer sees value, increases usage
- Identify additional use cases
- Plan expansion to other teams

**Key metric: Time to First Value**
- Target: <7 days from contract to first completed task
- Faster time to value = higher retention, faster expansion

## Overcoming Common Objections

### Objection 1: "What if the AI makes a mistake?"

**Bad response**: "Our AI is 95% accurate, so mistakes are rare."

**Why it's bad**: Acknowledges mistakes happen, doesn't address consequences.

**Good response**: "Great question. Let's address that directly:

1. **Our AI is 95% accurate** on benchmarks, comparable to junior professionals.

2. **We recommend human review** for all AI outputs (takes 10% of time vs. doing work from scratch).

3. **We have $5M E&O insurance** to cover any errors that cause financial loss.

4. **You control what AI handles**. Start with low-risk work (NDAs, routine contracts). Keep high-risk work (M&A, litigation) with your team.

5. **Pilot first**. Try us on 10 real tasks, compare to your team's work. If accuracy isn't 95%+, walk away.

Does that address your concern?"

**Why it works**: Acknowledges concern, provides multiple layers of mitigation, invites customer to verify claims.

### Objection 2: "We need the human relationship / judgment / expertise"

**Bad response**: "AI can do the work faster and cheaper."

**Why it's bad**: Misses the point. Customer values human connection, not just task completion.

**Good response**: "I completely agree. Human judgment and relationships are irreplaceable.

Here's how we think about it:

**Humans are great at:**
- Strategic thinking (what's the right approach?)
- Building client relationships (trust, rapport)
- Handling novel situations (first-of-kind transactions)
- Exercising judgment in gray areas

**AI is great at:**
- Repetitive tasks (reviewing 100 similar contracts)
- Pattern recognition (flagging risks across thousands of documents)
- Speed (10x faster on routine work)

**Our customers use AI for routine work**, freeing their experts to focus on high-value tasks: strategy, client relationships, and complex judgment calls.

**Example**: Allen & Overy uses Harvey AI for research and contract review, but their attorneys focus on strategic advice and client relationships.

Result: Associates are 3x more productive, clients get faster turnaround on routine work, and attorneys focus on what they do best—strategic thinking and client relationships.

Does that resonate with how you think about your team?"

**Why it works**: Reframes AI as complement, not replacement. Shows you understand and value human expertise.

### Objection 3: "Our work is too complex / specialized / unique for AI"

**Bad response**: "AI can handle complexity."

**Why it's bad**: Generic claim, doesn't address customer's specific domain.

**Good response**: "I hear that a lot, and you may be right for some of your work.

Can you tell me more about what makes your work unique? [LISTEN]

Okay, so you're saying [reflect back their concern].

Let me share how we've handled similar cases:

[Show case study from similar customer]

That said, I'm not claiming AI can do everything. Here's what I'd suggest:

1. **Let's start with a real example from your work**. Share a recent [contract/document/task] and we'll process it live. You tell us if the output meets your standards.

2. **If it works, pilot on 10-20 more examples**. That'll give us both confidence it works for your specific domain.

3. **If it doesn't work, we walk away**. No hard feelings.

The only way to know if AI works for your use case is to test it. Are you open to that?"

**Why it works**: Takes objection seriously, proposes concrete test, doesn't oversell.

### Objection 4: "We're worried about job loss / our team resisting"

**Bad response**: "AI will replace some jobs, but that's progress."

**Why it's bad**: Confirms fear, doesn't help customer navigate change management.

**Good response**: "That's a really important concern, and I appreciate you raising it.

Here's how our most successful customers have handled this:

**1. Position AI as augmentation, not replacement:**

'We're not reducing headcount. We're making our team 5x more productive.'

Example: Law firm used AI to handle increased client demand without hiring more associates. No layoffs, more business.

**2. Upskill team to manage AI:**

Train team on AI review, quality control, and handling complex cases AI escalates. This is a new skill set—makes them more valuable, not less.

**3. Redeploy to higher-value work:**

Example: Accounting firm used AI for bookkeeping, redeployed accountants to CFO advisory. Higher value work = higher billable rates = more profit.

**4. Natural attrition handles headcount:**

Most firms don't lay off when adopting AI. They just don't backfill when people leave naturally. Headcount gradually adjusts over 12-24 months.

**5. Communicate early and honestly:**

Tell your team: 'We're adopting AI to be more competitive. Your jobs aren't at risk, but your responsibilities will evolve.'

Would any of these approaches work for your situation?"

**Why it works**: Shows empathy, provides playbook for managing change, frames AI positively.

### Objection 5: "The price is too high"

**Bad response**: "Okay, I can offer a 20% discount."

**Why it's bad**: Discounting without understanding objection signals desperation, trains customer to negotiate.

**Good response**: "I appreciate you raising that. Can you help me understand your thinking?

**Is the concern:**

**A) Budget constraint** ("We can't afford this right now")
→ "Understood. Can we start with a smaller pilot? $X/month for first 3 months, then scale if ROI is proven."

**B) ROI concern** ("Not sure the value justifies the cost")
→ "Let's calculate ROI together:
- You currently pay $Y for this work (attorney time, overhead)
- Our service costs $X
- Savings: $Y - $X = $Z/month
- Payback: 1-2 months

If we can't prove $Z in savings within first month, I'll refund your payment. Fair?"

**C) Comparison shopping** ("Competitor X is cheaper")
→ "That's good to know. How are you comparing?
- Are you comparing accuracy? (Ours is 95%, theirs is 85%)
- Are you comparing scope? (We include human review, they don't)
- Are you comparing total cost? (They charge for overages, we're flat rate)

Let's do a true apples-to-apples comparison. Would that help?"

**Why it works**: Uncovers real objection (often not actually about price), demonstrates ROI or differentiates on value.

## The Services-as-Software Sales Process

### Phase 1: Discovery (Understand Pain Points)

**Goal**: Understand what customer currently does, how much it costs, what they're dissatisfied with.

**Discovery questions:**

**Current process:**
- "Walk me through how you currently do [task]."
- "How many [contracts/transactions/tickets] do you handle per month?"
- "How long does each one take?"
- "Who does this work? (role, experience level)"

**Pain points:**
- "What's most frustrating about your current process?"
- "Where do bottlenecks occur?"
- "What happens when you have a spike in volume?"
- "Have you had quality issues or errors? What was the impact?"

**Economics:**
- "What's your fully loaded cost for this work?" (salary + benefits + overhead + tools)
- "What do you pay external providers?" (law firms, accounting firms, agencies)
- "How much would you save if this process was 5x faster?"

**Decision process:**
- "Who else needs to be involved in evaluating this?" (legal, IT, procurement, C-suite)
- "What's your timeline for making a decision?"
- "What would success look like for you?"

**Why discovery matters**: You can't sell effectively without understanding customer's economics, pain points, and decision process.

### Phase 2: Customized Demo

**Goal**: Show how your product solves their specific problem (not generic demo).

**Demo structure:**

**1. Recap pain points (2 minutes)**
"Based on our conversation, here's what I heard:
- You review 200 contracts/month
- Each takes 2 hours
- Costs $600 per contract ($300/hour attorney rate)
- Total: $120K/month

Your biggest pain: Finding attorneys who can do this work, turnaround time is 3-5 days.

Did I get that right? [CONFIRM]

Great. Let me show you how we solve this."

**2. Live demo on customer data (10 minutes)**

"Let's use one of your actual contracts. Can you share one you recently reviewed?

[Customer uploads employment agreement]

[AI processes in real-time]

Here's the output:
- Risk analysis with 7 issues identified
- Comparison to market standards
- Recommended redlines

This took 3 minutes. Your associate spent 2 hours. Let's compare the outputs side-by-side.

[Walk through comparison]

Questions?"

**3. ROI calculation (5 minutes)**

"Let's calculate what this means for your business:

**Current state:**
- 200 contracts/month × 2 hours × $300/hour = $120K/month

**With AI:**
- 200 contracts × 3 minutes × $50/contract = $10K/month
- + 30 minutes attorney review per contract × $300/hour = $30K/month
- **Total: $40K/month** (67% cost reduction)

**Savings: $80K/month = $960K/year**

**Our price: $5K/month = $60K/year**

**Net savings: $900K/year**

**Payback: Less than 1 month**

Does this math make sense based on your numbers?"

**4. Next steps (3 minutes)**

"Here's what I propose:

1. **Pilot**: 30 days, 50 contracts, $5K. You evaluate quality against your standards.
2. **Review results**: End of pilot, we compare accuracy, speed, cost.
3. **Decision**: If pilot proves out, expand to full volume. If not, we walk away.

Does this sound like a reasonable next step?"

**Why this works**: Addresses specific pain, shows concrete ROI, proposes low-risk pilot.

### Phase 3: Pilot Execution

**Goal**: Prove value with customer's real work.

**Pilot structure:**

**Week 1: Onboarding**
- Integrate with customer systems
- Train on customer-specific requirements
- Process first 5 test contracts

**Week 2-3: Volume processing**
- Customer submits 20-25 contracts/week
- AI processes within 24 hours
- Customer reviews outputs, provides feedback

**Week 4: Results review**

**Pilot results meeting agenda:**

"Thanks for participating in the pilot. Here's what we measured:

**Volume**: 50 contracts processed

**Accuracy**: 94% (customer validated)
- 47 contracts: AI output met standards (no edits needed)
- 3 contracts: Minor edits required (5-10 minutes each)

**Speed**: Average 3.2 minutes per contract (vs. 2 hours baseline)
- Total AI time: 160 minutes (2.7 hours)
- vs. Human baseline: 100 hours
- **Time savings: 97 hours (97% reduction)**

**Cost**:
- AI: $2,500 ($50/contract × 50)
- Human review: $750 (1.5 hours × $300/hour)
- **Total: $3,250**
- vs. Human baseline: $30,000 (100 hours × $300/hour)
- **Cost savings: $26,750 (89% reduction)**

**Customer satisfaction**: 4.2/5 average rating on outputs

**What would you like to do next?"

**80% of well-executed pilots convert to paid contracts.**

### Phase 4: Negotiation and Close

**Goal**: Finalize contract and pricing.

**Common negotiation points:**

**1. Pricing**
- Customer asks for discount
- Response: "Our pricing is based on the ROI we deliver. In your pilot, you saved $27K for a $5K investment—5x ROI. The value speaks for itself. That said, I can offer 10% off if you commit to annual contract ($54K vs. $60K)."

**2. Contract length**
- Customer wants month-to-month
- Response: "We typically do annual contracts for two reasons: (1) it takes 3-6 months to see full value as your team learns to use AI effectively, and (2) we invest in custom training for your domain. That said, I can offer a 6-month contract with option to renew if that works better."

**3. Performance guarantees**
- Customer wants SLA
- Response: "Absolutely. We guarantee 95%+ accuracy (measured monthly). If we miss that threshold, you get 10% credit for that month and option to terminate. Fair?"

**4. Exclusivity / non-compete**
- Customer wants to ensure you won't work with competitors
- Response: "We serve multiple firms in your industry, which helps us improve quality. However, we never share customer data or custom training. Your data and workflows are confidential. Would that work?"

### Phase 5: Post-Sale Expansion

**Goal**: Grow account from pilot use case to enterprise-wide deployment.

**Expansion path:**

**Month 1-3: Prove value in pilot use case**
- Employment contracts only
- 50 contracts/month
- $5K/month

**Month 4-6: Expand to adjacent use cases**
- Add NDAs, vendor agreements
- 150 contracts/month
- $12K/month

**Month 7-12: Expand to other departments**
- Pilot started in Corporate team
- Expand to Litigation, IP, Tax
- 400 contracts/month
- $30K/month

**Month 13+: Enterprise-wide deployment**
- All practice areas
- Integration with document management
- Custom AI training
- 1,000+ contracts/month
- $75K/month

**Average expansion: 5-10x from initial contract within 12-18 months.**

## Building a Services-as-Software Sales Team

### When to Hire Sales

**Don't hire sales team until:**
1. **You (founder) have closed 10-20 deals yourself** (proven repeatable process)
2. **Sales cycle is <6 months** (predictable timeline)
3. **Pitch deck and demo are refined** (high conversion in demos)
4. **Target ACV >$25K** (can afford sales team economics)

**First hire: Sales Engineer (SE) before AE**
- SE helps with demos and pilots
- Frees founder to focus on strategy
- Builds out technical sales assets
- Cost: $120K-$180K

**Second hire: First AE**
- Hire after closing 15-20 deals as founder
- Give them your proven playbook
- Target: $1M-$1.5M quota
- Cost: $120K base + $120K variable = $240K OTE

### Sales Team Structure

**Series A (first sales hires):**
- 1 AE
- 1 SE (shared)
- Founder as VP Sales

**Series B (building team):**
- 3-5 AEs
- 2 SEs
- 1-2 SDRs (if outbound)
- VP Sales (if founder wants to step back)

**Series C (scaling):**
- 10-20 AEs
- 5 SEs
- 5-10 SDRs
- VP Sales + Sales Directors

### Sales Compensation

**Account Executive (AE):**
```
Base: $120K
Variable: $120K (at 100% quota)
OTE: $240K
Quota: $1.2M bookings (5x OTE)
```

**Sales Engineer (SE):**
```
Base: $140K
Variable: $40K
OTE: $180K
(SEs are less commission-heavy, more collaborative)
```

**SDR:**
```
Base: $60K
Variable: $40K
OTE: $100K
Quota: 20 qualified opportunities per quarter
```

## Key Takeaways

**1. Selling SaS is about building trust, not features**
- Customers aren't evaluating "does this software have X feature?"
- They're evaluating "can I trust AI to replace our experts?"
- Three-stage process: Demonstrate → De-Risk → Deliver

**2. Show, don't tell**
- Live demo on customer's real data > generic demo
- Free pilot on real work > sales deck
- Side-by-side comparison > claims of superiority

**3. De-risk the purchase**
- Money-back guarantees (first 30-90 days)
- SLAs with penalties (95%+ accuracy guaranteed)
- E&O insurance ($5M+ coverage)
- Start small (pilot 10% of work before scaling)

**4. Address objections directly**
- "What if AI makes mistakes?" → Insurance, guarantees, human review
- "We need human judgment" → AI for routine, humans for strategy
- "Our work is too complex" → Pilot and prove it
- "Worried about jobs" → Augmentation not replacement, change management playbook

**5. Discovery > Demo**
- Understand pain points, economics, decision process
- Customize demo to their specific situation
- Calculate ROI based on their numbers, not generic examples

**6. Pilots convert at 70-80%**
- 30-day pilot with real work
- Measure accuracy, speed, cost savings
- Weekly check-ins, final results presentation
- Most pilots convert if executed well

**7. Don't hire sales team too early**
- Founder sells first 10-20 deals (prove process works)
- Hire SE before AE (help with technical demos)
- First AE at $1M-$2M ARR, scale team after $5M ARR
