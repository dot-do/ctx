# Chapter 12: Marketing and Positioning

In 2022, two AI contract review startups launched:

**Startup A** positioned as: "AI-Powered Contract Review Software"
- Website looked like every other legal tech company
- Messaging focused on features ("GPT-4-based", "95% accurate", "fast API")
- Targeted "all lawyers"

**Result**: Struggled to differentiate. Customers confused them with 10 other "AI contract review" tools. $200K ARR after 18 months.

**Startup B** (Harvey AI) positioned as: "Generative AI for Elite Law Firms"
- Clear target: AmLaw 100 firms (not all lawyers)
- Differentiation: Partnership with Allen & Overy (instant credibility)
- Messaging: "Professional-grade AI trusted by the world's leading law firms"

**Result**: Clear positioning. Customers understood "this is the premium AI for serious law firms." $100M raised, 10,000+ users.

**The difference**: Positioning. Harvey didn't have better technology—they had better marketing.

This chapter teaches you how to position Services-as-Software for maximum impact.

## Why Positioning Matters More Than Ever

### The AI Noise Problem

**2021**: Few AI products. Being "AI-powered" was differentiating.

**2024**: Everyone claims to be AI-powered. "AI" is table stakes, not a differentiator.

**Search for "AI contract review":**
- 50+ results
- All claim 95%+ accuracy
- All claim 10x faster than humans
- All claim "GPT-4 powered"

**Customer reaction**: "They all look the same. How do I choose?"

**Your challenge**: Stand out in a crowded, noisy market where everyone claims similar capabilities.

### The Three Components of Positioning

**1. Who you serve (Target Customer)**
- "Legal AI for all lawyers" (too broad)
- "Legal AI for corporate associates at AmLaw 100 firms" (specific, defensible)

**2. What you do (Category)**
- "Contract review software" (generic)
- "AI paralegal that never sleeps" (category creation)

**3. Why you're different (Differentiation)**
- "95% accurate" (everyone claims this)
- "Trusted by Allen & Overy and 50 AmLaw 100 firms" (proof-based differentiation)

**Positioning formula:**

```
We help [TARGET CUSTOMER] [ACHIEVE OUTCOME] through [CATEGORY/APPROACH], unlike [ALTERNATIVE] which [LIMITATION].
```

**Examples:**

**Harvey AI:**
"We help elite law firms handle 10x more legal work through AI that thinks like a lawyer, unlike traditional legal research tools that just search keywords."

**Pilot.com:**
"We help venture-backed startups get CFO-level bookkeeping through AI + expert accountants, unlike traditional bookkeepers who lack the expertise startups need."

**Jasper:**
"We help marketing teams create professional content 10x faster through AI trained on high-performing marketing copy, unlike generic AI tools that produce generic output."

## Positioning Strategy 1: Vertical Domination

**What it is**: Own one specific vertical/use case completely before expanding.

**Example: Harvey AI**
- **Target**: Corporate lawyers at elite law firms
- **Use case**: Legal research and contract review
- **NOT targeting**: Solo practitioners, in-house counsel, criminal defense, family law (yet)

**Why it works:**
- Easier to build trust in one vertical (word of mouth spreads within community)
- Can customize product deeply for one use case (vs. generic for all)
- Clear messaging ("We're the legal AI for BigLaw")
- Less competition (most competitors go horizontal)

**How to execute:**

**Step 1: Pick your beachhead vertical**
- Where do you have unfair advantage? (network, expertise, case studies)
- Which vertical has highest pain? (most expensive, most time-consuming)
- Which vertical has budget? (can afford your solution)

**Step 2: Dominate messaging in that vertical**
- Website speaks directly to that vertical ("For SaaS CFOs" not "For finance professionals")
- Case studies all from that vertical
- Content addresses vertical-specific problems
- Attend vertical-specific conferences

**Step 3: Build vertical-specific features**
- Integrations with tools that vertical uses (QuickBooks for accounting, Salesforce for sales)
- Terminology that vertical uses (not generic terms)
- Workflows optimized for that vertical

**Step 4: Expand to adjacent verticals**
- After dominating one vertical ($5M+ ARR), expand to similar verticals
- Example: Harvey started with corporate law → expanding to litigation, IP, tax

**Vertical positioning examples:**

**Pilot.com (Bookkeeping for Startups):**
- Target: Venture-backed startups ($1M-$100M revenue)
- NOT targeting: Small businesses, enterprises, non-profits (initially)
- Messaging: "Bookkeeping and CFO services built for startups"
- Features: Startup-specific (burn rate tracking, investor reporting, venture debt scenarios)

**Result**: Became known as "the bookkeeping company for startups." $120M ARR.

**Ramp (Corporate Cards for Startups):**
- Target: Startups and high-growth tech companies
- NOT targeting: Traditional businesses (initially)
- Messaging: "Corporate cards designed for how you work"
- Features: Startup-specific (fast approvals, high limits for pre-revenue, integrations with startup tools)

**Result**: $5.4B valuation, 25% of venture-backed startups use Ramp.

## Positioning Strategy 2: Category Creation

**What it is**: Create a new category instead of competing in existing one.

**Example: Intercom**
- **Old category**: "Live chat software" (competing with Zendesk, Olark, 50+ others)
- **New category**: "Conversational Relationship Platform" (CRP)
- **Result**: Became category leader, $1B+ valuation

**Why it works:**
- First mover advantage in new category
- Define category = define buyer criteria (criteria that favor your strengths)
- Premium pricing (new categories command higher prices than commodities)

**How to create a category:**

**Step 1: Identify the gap**
- What are customers trying to do that existing categories don't address?
- What's the outcome customers want (not features they need)?

**Example: Pilot.com**
- Gap: Startups need bookkeeping + CFO advisory + tax, but traditionally those are separate services
- Outcome: "Financial clarity without hiring a full-time CFO"
- New category: "Finance as a Service" (not just bookkeeping)

**Step 2: Name the category**
- Descriptive (clear what it does)
- Memorable (easy to say and remember)
- Not already taken (avoid confusion)

**Examples:**
- **Services-as-Software** (this book!)
- **Revenue Operations** (combining sales, marketing, customer success ops)
- **Product-Led Growth** (category Amplitude/Mixpanel helped create)
- **Composable Commerce** (Contentful, others)

**Step 3: Educate the market**
- Write definitive guide to the category
- Create category-defining content (blog posts, ebooks, podcasts)
- Speak at conferences about the category (not just your product)
- Partner with analysts (Gartner, Forrester) to validate category

**Example: HubSpot creating "Inbound Marketing"**
- Published definitive book: *Inbound Marketing* (2009)
- Built massive blog about inbound (not just HubSpot product)
- Ran annual conference: Inbound (50,000+ attendees)
- Result: Became synonymous with category, $28B market cap

**Step 4: Own the category**
- Your company name should be top-of-mind when someone thinks of category
- "AI for legal = Harvey"
- "Finance for startups = Pilot"
- "AI-native search = Perplexity"

**When category creation works:**
- You have resources for 12-24 months of education (content, events, PR)
- Market is ready (pain exists, but no good category describes solution)
- You can articulate category clearly (customers understand it immediately)

**When category creation doesn't work:**
- Confusing or jargon-y category name
- Market isn't ready (trying to create category for problem people don't know they have)
- Insufficient resources to educate market

## Positioning Strategy 3: Contrast Positioning

**What it is**: Define yourself by contrasting with the dominant alternative.

**Framework:** "We're like [familiar thing], but [key difference]"

**Examples:**

**Jasper (2021):**
"We're like hiring a content writer, but 100x faster and available 24/7."
- Familiar: Content writer
- Difference: Speed and availability

**GitHub Copilot:**
"We're like pair programming with an expert, but the expert is an AI that knows millions of codebases."
- Familiar: Pair programming
- Difference: Knowledge breadth

**Harvey AI:**
"We're like having a junior associate who never sleeps, never forgets, and has read every case ever published."
- Familiar: Junior associate
- Difference: Always available, perfect memory, comprehensive knowledge

**Why it works:**
- Customers immediately understand what you do (anchoring to familiar concept)
- Clearly communicates value (speed, scale, cost, quality vs. alternative)
- Positions you as evolution, not revolution (less scary for risk-averse buyers)

**How to execute:**

**Step 1: Identify the dominant alternative**
- What do customers use today? (human services, incumbent software, manual processes)
- Harvey: "Legal research associates"
- Pilot: "Traditional bookkeepers"
- Jasper: "Content writers / agencies"

**Step 2: Identify key difference that customers care about**
- Not just "we use AI" (table stakes)
- Focus on outcome difference: faster, cheaper, more consistent, more scalable

**Step 3: Craft simple contrast statement**

**Formula:**
```
We're like [FAMILIAR ALTERNATIVE], but [10X BETTER ON DIMENSION CUSTOMERS CARE ABOUT].
```

**Examples:**
- "We're like a CFO, but $10K/month instead of $200K/year"
- "We're like an attorney, but $50 per contract instead of $600"
- "We're like a content team, but 10x faster"

**Step 4: Use contrast in all messaging**
- Website headline
- Pitch deck (slide 2: "The Problem with [Alternative]")
- Sales conversations (comparison tables)
- Case studies (before/after)

## Content Marketing Strategy

### The Three Content Pillars

**Pillar 1: Educational Content (Build Authority)**

**Goal**: Establish your company as the expert in your category.

**Content types:**
- **Ultimate guides**: "The Complete Guide to AI Contract Review" (5,000-10,000 words)
- **How-to articles**: "How to Review 100 Contracts in One Day"
- **Best practices**: "7 Contract Clauses Every Startup Should Negotiate"

**Distribution:**
- SEO (rank for "[category] guide")
- LinkedIn (share insights)
- Email newsletter (weekly tips)

**Example: Pilot.com's content strategy**
- Published 500+ articles on startup finance
- Topics: Bookkeeping, taxes, fundraising, financial planning
- Result: #1 in Google for "startup bookkeeping", 100K monthly blog visitors

**Pillar 2: Social Proof Content (Build Trust)**

**Goal**: Prove that other companies trust you and get results.

**Content types:**
- **Case studies**: "How Acme Corp Saved $500K with AI Contract Review"
- **Customer testimonials**: Video testimonials from recognizable customers
- **Customer logos**: Display prestigious customers on homepage

**Structure of great case studies:**
```
1. Customer background (who they are, what they do)
2. Challenge (pain point before using your product)
3. Solution (how they use your product)
4. Results (metrics: time saved, cost saved, quality improvement)
5. Quote (customer saying product is great)

Example:

"Acme Corp, a Series B SaaS company, was spending $120K/month on legal contract review.

Challenge: Their in-house legal team was overwhelmed with 200+ contracts/month. Review took 3-5 days, blocking sales.

Solution: Implemented Harvey AI for contract review. AI handles initial review (3 minutes), attorneys verify (30 minutes).

Results:
- Cost: $120K/month → $40K/month (67% reduction)
- Speed: 3-5 days → same-day turnaround
- Volume: Handling 300+ contracts/month (50% increase)

Quote: 'Harvey gave us superpowers. We're handling 50% more contracts with the same team.' - Jane Doe, General Counsel"

- Conference talks

**Example: Scale AI's CEO Alexandr Wang**
- Regular posts on LinkedIn about AI trends (millions of views)
- Op-eds in WSJ, FT about AI policy
- Positioned Scale as AI thought leader, not just "data labeling company"

### Content Calendar

**Weekly cadence:**
- 1 blog post (Educational or Thought Leadership)
- 3-5 LinkedIn posts (short-form insights)
- 1 email newsletter (recap of blog + curated content)

**Monthly cadence:**
- 1 case study (Social Proof)
- 1 webinar (deep dive on specific topic)
- 1 guest post or podcast appearance

**Quarterly cadence:**
- 1 ultimate guide (long-form, comprehensive)
- 1 product launch or major announcement
- 1 conference talk or major PR push

## Brand Strategy

### Building a Services-as-Software Brand

**Key brand attributes:**

**1. Professional (not cute or playful)**
- Services-as-Software replaces professionals → brand must signal professionalism
- Examples: Harvey (serious, minimalist), Pilot (clean, trustworthy)
- Counter-example: Don't use playful illustrations or casual copy for enterprise SaS

**2. Trustworthy (proof over claims)**
- Show, don't tell: Customer logos, case studies, metrics
- Avoid hyperbole: "We're the best AI" → "Trusted by 50 AmLaw 100 firms"

**3. Expert (demonstrate domain knowledge)**
- Content shows deep understanding of customer's domain
- Team includes domain experts (ex-lawyers, ex-accountants, ex-consultants)
- Speak customer's language (use industry terms, not generic AI jargon)

**Visual identity:**

**For legal/finance SaS:**
- Colors: Navy, dark blue, white (trust, professionalism)
- Typography: Serif fonts (traditional, authoritative)
- Imagery: Real people (customers, team), not stock photos

**For creative/marketing SaS:**
- Colors: Bright, energetic (but not childish)
- Typography: Modern sans-serif
- Imagery: Outputs (showcasing quality), not abstract "AI" visuals

**For developer tools:**
- Colors: Dark mode friendly (grays, accent colors)
- Typography: Monospace for code, clean sans-serif otherwise
- Imagery: Code examples, IDE screenshots, technical diagrams

### Brand Voice

**Harvey AI brand voice:**
- Confident, not arrogant
- Professional, not stuffy
- Helpful, not salesy

**Example copy:**
- ✅ "Harvey helps lawyers do their best work, faster."
- ❌ "Harvey is the world's #1 revolutionary AI-powered legal platform that will change everything!"

**Pilot.com brand voice:**
- Approachable, not casual
- Expert, not condescending
- Empowering, not overwhelming

**Example copy:**
- ✅ "Your finances, handled. Finally."
- ❌ "OMG your bookkeeping is gonna be so easy now!!!"

## Competitive Positioning

### The Comparison Page

**Every SaS company needs a comparison page:**

**Structure:**
```
Headline: [Your Company] vs. [Alternative]

Overview:
Brief comparison (Your Company for X, Alternative for Y)

Feature Comparison Table:
| Feature | Your Company | Alternative |
| Speed | 3 minutes | 2 hours |
| Cost | $50 | $600 |
| Quality | 95% | 90% |
| Human review | Included | Not included |
| Support | 24/7 | Email only |

Detailed Comparison:
- When to choose Your Company: (use cases, customer types)
- When to choose Alternative: (be fair—acknowledge when they might be better fit)

Case Studies:
- "Why Acme Corp Switched from [Alternative] to [Your Company]"
```

**Comparison types:**

**1. AI vs. Human**
- Your AI vs. Traditional lawyers/accountants/writers
- Focus on speed, cost, consistency
- Acknowledge humans needed for complex work

**2. Your AI vs. Competitor AI**
- Compare quality, features, pricing
- Focus on differentiation (vertical specialization, partnerships, quality)

**3. AI-Assisted vs. Fully Automated**
- Your hybrid approach vs. pure automation
- Focus on trust (human review = quality assurance)

### How to Handle Competitors

**In sales conversations:**

**If customer mentions competitor:**
- "That's a great company. They focus on [X], we focus on [Y]. It really depends on your priorities."
- Don't bad-mouth competitors (makes you look insecure)
- Differentiate on your strengths (not their weaknesses)

**If competitor is attacking you:**
- Respond with data (not emotions)
- Example: If competitor claims better accuracy, publish your benchmark results
- Take high road (focus on your customers, not competitor)

## Launch Strategy

### Pre-Launch (4-6 weeks before)

**Build anticipation:**

**Tactics:**
- Teaser campaign (LinkedIn, Twitter): "Something big is coming"
- Early access list (collect emails, give first access to list)
- Beta customers (give 10-20 customers early access, collect testimonials)
- Press outreach (brief journalists, embargo until launch day)

**Goal: 500-1,000 email addresses on waitlist**

### Launch Day

**Coordinated launch:**

**8am PT: Launch announcement**
- Blog post (detailed product announcement)
- Email to waitlist (first access)
- Social media posts (LinkedIn, Twitter)

- Share customer testimonials
- Share demo videos

**Goal: 5,000+ website visitors, 100+ trials, top 3 on Product Hunt**

### Post-Launch (Weeks 1-4)

**Sustain momentum:**

**Week 1-2:**
- Customer success: Onboard trial users, get them to activation
- Content: Publish case study from beta customer
- Follow-up: Email trial users who haven't activated

**Week 3-4:**
- Content: Publish "How to" guide (help customers get value)
- Sales: Reach out to high-intent trials (multiple visits, long session times)
- PR: Follow-up interviews and guest posts

**Goal: 10-20% of trials convert to paid by end of month**

## Key Takeaways

**1. Positioning is strategy, not copy**
- Who you serve (target customer)
- What you do (category)
- Why you're different (differentiation)
- Get this right before worrying about website copy

**2. Three positioning strategies**
- **Vertical domination**: Own one vertical completely (Harvey = legal for elite firms)
- **Category creation**: Create new category, become leader (Intercom = CRP)
- **Contrast positioning**: "We're like X, but Y" (Jasper = writers, but 100x faster)

**3. Message for the buyer, not yourself**
- Economic buyers: ROI, risk mitigation
- End users: Day-to-day benefits, quality of life
- Technical buyers: Security, integration, architecture

**4. Content builds trust and authority**
- Educational content: Establish expertise
- Social proof: Customer logos, case studies, testimonials

- Your AI vs. Competitor AI
- Be fair, focus on when you're the right fit

**7. Launch is just the beginning**
- Pre-launch: Build anticipation (waitlist, beta, press)
- Launch day: Coordinated push (blog, email, social, Product Hunt, press)
- Post-launch: Convert trials, sustain momentum
