# Chapter 1: The $4.6 Trillion Landscape

When OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, Anna Chen immediately saw the implications for her industry. As a senior software engineer who'd spent five years building internal tools for law firms, she understood both the technology and the market.

"Legal work is mostly pattern matching," she told her co-founder. "Contracts, briefs, memos—they follow templates. Senior lawyers add judgment and customization, but 70% of the work is routine. ChatGPT can do that."

Within three months, they'd built a prototype legal research tool. Within six months, they had 50 paying law firms. Within 18 months, they'd raised $30M at a $150M valuation.

Anna had identified her opportunity correctly: Legal services are a $1.5 trillion market where most work is automatable with AI. But she could have chosen accounting ($1.5T), IT/development ($1.5T), consulting ($450B), customer support ($200B), or creative services ($500B).

This chapter helps you identify which piece of the $4.6 trillion professional services market is right for you.

## Market Sizing: Total Addressable vs. Serviceable

For each category, understand three numbers:

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):** All spending in the category

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):** Portion amenable to AI automation

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):** Portion you can realistically capture

Example: **Legal contract review**

- TAM: $1.5T (all legal services)
- SAM: $300B (contract-related legal work)
- Automatable: $210B (70% of contract work is routine)
- SOM Year 5: $3B (1% market share, realistic for category leader)

**Key insight:** 1% of a large SAM beats 50% of a small SAM.

Harvey AI is targeting 1-2% of $300B legal work = $3-6B opportunity
Not 50% of $6B niche = $3B opportunity

Think big, start focused.

## Vertical vs. Horizontal Opportunities

Every SaS opportunity can be characterized as vertical or horizontal:

**Vertical = Deep in one domain**
- Example: Harvey AI for legal
- Pros: Faster PMF, easier to build trust, clear value prop
- Cons: Limited TAM, harder to expand

**Horizontal = Shallow across multiple domains**
- Example: ChatGPT for all text generation
- Pros: Massive TAM, easier to expand, platform effects
- Cons: Slower PMF, harder to differentiate, trust challenges

**The paradox:** Most successful companies start vertical and go horizontal.

**Start vertical:**
- Legal research for M&A lawyers
- Bookkeeping for SaaS startups
- Support for SaaS companies
- Code generation for Python web apps

**Expand horizontal:**
- Legal research for all practice areas
- Bookkeeping for all small businesses
- Support for all industries
- Code generation for all languages

Chapter 3 covers this decision in depth. For now: **default to vertical unless you have extraordinary distribution.**

## Your Unfair Advantage

The best opportunity for you depends on your unfair advantage. Three types:

### Advantage Type 1: Domain Expertise

You deeply understand a professional service category.

**Examples:**
- Former lawyer building legal AI
- Ex-accountant building bookkeeping AI
- Senior developer building coding AI
- Support manager building support AI

**Your advantage:**
- Know quality standards and workflows
- Understand customer pain deeply
- Can evaluate AI outputs accurately
- Have credibility with buyers

**Best opportunities:**
- High-accuracy domains (legal, accounting)
- Complex workflows (consulting, development)
- Regulated industries (finance, healthcare)

**Risk mitigation:**
- Partner with technical co-founder
- Hire engineering leadership early
- Use off-the-shelf AI where possible

### Advantage Type 2: Distribution

You have access to customers.

**Examples:**
- Intercom building Fin (100K+ existing customers)
- GitHub building Copilot (100M+ developers)
- Salesforce building Einstein (150K+ customers)
- Professional services firm building tools for peers

**Your advantage:**
- Can launch to existing base
- Trust already established
- Faster feedback loops
- Lower CAC

**Best opportunities:**
- Adjacent to existing product
- Serves existing customer base
- Leverages existing brand

**Risk mitigation:**
- Ensure new product has own value
- Don't assume existing customers will adopt
- May need separate GTM motion

### Advantage Type 3: Technology

You have unique AI/technical capability.

**Examples:**
- AI researchers building domain-specific models
- Engineers with proprietary data
- Technical team with specialized infrastructure
- Platform with unique AI capabilities

**Your advantage:**
- Can build what others can't (yet)
- Technology moat (temporarily)
- First mover in new capability

**Best opportunities:**
- Technically complex domains
- Where accuracy is differentiator
- Where speed of innovation matters

**Risk mitigation:**
- Technology moats erode quickly
- Need to build domain expertise fast
- Distribution still required

**Most successful SaS companies have 2 of 3 advantages:**
- Domain + Distribution: Pilot.com (founded by startup operator with network)
- Domain + Technology: Harvey AI (lawyers + AI researchers)
- Distribution + Technology: GitHub Copilot (GitHub brand + OpenAI partnership)

**Having only 1 advantage is doable but harder. Having 0 means you're competing on execution alone.**

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: AI Legal Research (Harvey AI's initial opportunity)

1. Market Size: 9/10 ($50B+ legal research market)
2. Automation: 9/10 (80% of research is pattern matching)
3. Customer Pain: 8/10 (lawyers hate legal research, expensive)
4. Willingness to Pay: 9/10 (firms pay $500K+ for Westlaw, Lexis)
5. Competitive: 7/10 (few AI competitors in 2022, incumbents slow)
6. Regulatory: 6/10 (attorney-client privilege concerns, unauthorized practice)
7. Distribution: 8/10 (enterprise sales, partnerships, PLG possible)
8. Advantage: 9/10 (domain expertise + AI capability)

**Weighted Score: 82/100 (Exceptional)**

Harvey pursued this opportunity and raised $100M at $700M valuation within 18 months.

### Example 2: AI Bookkeeping for Startups (Pilot.com's opportunity)

1. Market Size: 7/10 ($2-3B startup bookkeeping market)
2. Automation: 10/10 (90%+ of bookkeeping is automatable)
3. Customer Pain: 9/10 (startups desperate, can't afford Big 4)
4. Willingness to Pay: 7/10 (paying $1-3K/month currently)
5. Competitive: 8/10 (QuickBooks not AI-powered, few AI competitors)
6. Regulatory: 9/10 (minimal barriers, human oversight allowed)
7. Distribution: 8/10 (content marketing, partnerships, PLG)
8. Advantage: 8/10 (founder had domain + distribution network)

**Weighted Score: 81/100 (Exceptional)**

Pilot.com reached $120M ARR within 5 years.

### Example 3: AI Strategy Consulting (Hypothetical)

1. Market Size: 8/10 ($15B+ strategy consulting market)
2. Automation: 4/10 (40% of work is automatable—mostly analysis, not strategy)
3. Customer Pain: 6/10 (pain exists but relationships matter more)
4. Willingness to Pay: 10/10 (paying $500K+ for McKinsey projects)
5. Competitive: 9/10 (no AI competitors, incumbents very slow)
6. Regulatory: 10/10 (no regulatory barriers)
7. Distribution: 3/10 (relationship sales only, very long cycles)
8. Advantage: 5/10 (hard to get domain expertise at McKinsey level)

**Weighted Score: 59/100 (Moderate—proceed with caution)**

Low automation potential and difficult distribution make this challenging despite large market and high willingness to pay.

## Common Mistakes in Opportunity Selection

### Mistake 1: Chasing the Largest TAM

"All professional services is our market" = unfocused, unwinnable.

Better: "Contract review for tech company M&A" (narrow but deep)

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Distribution

"If we build it, customers will come."

Reality: Distribution is often harder than product. Plan for it early.

### Mistake 3: Underestimating Incumbents

"Lawyers/accountants/consultants are slow and won't adapt."

Reality: Incumbents are responding. Some successfully. Don't underestimate.

### Mistake 4: Overestimating AI Capability

"AI can do 100% of [service]."

Reality: AI is very good but not perfect. Plan for human-in-the-loop.

### Mistake 5: Building Without Domain Expertise

"We're technical, we can figure out [legal/accounting/consulting]."

Reality: Domain expertise is critical. Partner with experts or learn deeply.

## Key Takeaways

1. **The $4.6T professional services market breaks into six categories:** Legal ($1.5T), Accounting ($1.5T), IT/Dev ($1.5T), Consulting ($450B), Support ($200B), Creative ($500B). Each has different automation potential and challenges.

2. **Automation potential varies: 55-85% depending on category.** Development, support, and accounting are most automatable. Consulting and creative services are harder.

3. **1% of $10B market beats 10% of $1B market.** Think big (TAM) but start focused (SOM).

4. **Vertical-first is right for 80% of first-time founders.** Easier to achieve product-market fit, build trust, and demonstrate value. Expand horizontally later.

5. **Your unfair advantage determines which opportunity to pursue.** Domain expertise, distribution, or technology—ideally you have two.

6. **Use the Opportunity Scoring Framework systematically.** Score across 8 weighted dimensions. 80+ is exceptional, 60-79 is strong, below 60 requires caution.

7. **Common mistakes: Chasing TAM, ignoring distribution, underestimating incumbents, overestimating AI, lacking domain expertise.** Avoid these by being systematic and honest.

8. **The best opportunities have: large market, high automation potential, desperate customers, willingness to pay, manageable competition, clear distribution, and your unfair advantage.**

The $4.6 trillion opportunity is real. Your job is to identify which specific piece of it is right for you.
