## Key Themes

### 1. Honest Assessment
Don't sugarcoat: routine work will be automated. Be clear about what's at risk.

### 2. Agency and Control
You have more control than you think. Choices matter. Adaptation is possible.

### 3. Skills Over Credentials
What you can do matters more than degrees or years of experience.

### 4. Speed Matters
The window for adaptation is 2-4 years. Act now, not later.

### 5. AI as Amplifier
AI augments good professionals exponentially. Poor professionals get marginal benefit.

## Differentiation from Books 1-2

**Book 1 (Business-as-Code)**: Broad organizational transformation
**Book 2 (Services-as-Software)**: Industry-level disruption
**Book 3 (This book)**: Personal career strategy

**Relationship**: Books 1-2 explain the transformation. Book 3 helps individuals navigate it personally.

## Key Case Studies / Examples

- **Sarah Chen**: Solo consultant earning $3.5M with AI augmentation (from Book 2)
- **Junior associate**: Saw document review automated, pivoted to strategic advisory
- **Mid-career accountant**: Transitioned from bookkeeping to fractional CFO services
- **Support agent**: Became AI support system designer
- **Developer**: Shifted from writing code to architecting agent systems
- **Content writer**: Evolved to brand strategist and AI content director

Each case study shows: **Before AI → During Transition → After Adaptation**
