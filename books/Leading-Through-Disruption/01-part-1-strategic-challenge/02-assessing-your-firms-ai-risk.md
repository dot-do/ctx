# Chapter 2: Assessing Your Firm's AI Risk

*"The most dangerous risk is the one you haven't measured."*

## The Partners' Meeting

The managing partner stood at the front of the conference room, facing twenty senior partners of one of the region's most respected accounting firms. The agenda item: AI disruption risk assessment.

"Look," one tax partner interrupted, "we've heard this before. Every few years there's some technology that's supposedly going to revolutionize accounting. Cloud computing, blockchain, RPA—we adapted to all of them. AI will be the same."

The managing partner had expected this. She clicked to the next slide.

"Fair point. Here's what's different. Our analysis shows that 73% of our junior staff's billable work could be automated by current AI tools. That's not a projection—that's technology available today. Our average audit takes 850 hours. With AI assistance, our pilot suggests it could take 320 hours. Same quality, maybe better. But our pricing is based on those 850 hours."

She paused to let that sink in.

"Here's the question that keeps me up at night: If we don't adopt AI and our competitors do, they can undercut our pricing by 50% while maintaining better margins. But if we do adopt AI, we cannibalize our own revenue. Either way, our current business model has maybe 24-36 months left."

The room went quiet.

"So," she continued, "the question isn't 'if' AI will disrupt us. The question is how vulnerable we are, how fast it's coming, and what we're going to do about it."

This chapter provides the framework to answer those questions for your firm.

## Why Risk Assessment Matters

Most firms approach AI adoption reactively: "Let's try this tool and see if it helps." But without systematic risk assessment, you're flying blind. You don't know:

**Which services are most vulnerable** to AI disruption and need immediate attention versus which have longer time horizons.

**How your revenue model creates exposure.** Firms with different pricing models face different risks—hourly billing firms are most vulnerable, but even value-based pricing has AI implications.

**Where competitors might attack.** Understanding your vulnerabilities shows you where competitors with aggressive AI adoption could gain advantage.

**What timeline you're operating on.** Some sectors face disruption in 12-18 months; others have 3-5 years. Knowing your timeline shapes your strategy.

**How to prioritize transformation efforts.** With limited resources, you need to address the highest-risk, highest-impact areas first.

Systematic risk assessment transforms vague anxiety ("AI might hurt our business") into specific understanding ("Our contract review services face 85% automation within 18 months and represent 40% of revenue; this is our highest priority").

## The Four Dimensions of AI Risk

Professional services firm risk to AI disruption operates across four interconnected dimensions. Weakness in any dimension creates vulnerability; strength in all dimensions doesn't eliminate risk but creates more strategic options.

### Dimension 1: Task Automation Exposure

**What percentage of your billable work could be automated by current or near-term AI?**

This is the most obvious dimension but requires honest analysis. Many firms underestimate their exposure by:

- Focusing on the most complex, judgment-intensive work while ignoring the volume of routine tasks
- Overestimating how much customization is required ("every client is different")
- Conflating "what AI does poorly today" with "what AI will do poorly in 18 months"

**Assessment methodology:**

**Step 1**: Break down your services into constituent tasks. For example, legal contract review includes:
- Identifying relevant clauses
- Checking clauses against standards
- Flagging unusual or risky terms
- Drafting suggested modifications
- Explaining changes to clients

**Step 2**: For each task, assess AI capability on a 1-5 scale:
- **1 (Not automatable)**: Requires complex human judgment, relationship, or physical presence
- **2 (Weakly augmented)**: AI provides some assistance but human does most of the work
- **3 (Strongly augmented)**: AI does bulk of work, human reviews and refines
- **4 (Mostly automated)**: Human reviews outputs but rarely modifies
- **5 (Fully automated)**: No human involvement needed

**Step 3**: Weight each task by % of billable hours and revenue.

**Step 4**: Calculate weighted automation exposure:
```
Automation Exposure = Σ (Task % × AI Capability Score) / 5
```

**Interpretation:**
- **0-20%**: Low exposure—most work remains human-driven
- **20-40%**: Moderate exposure—significant augmentation possible
- **40-60%**: High exposure—major portions of work automatable
- **60-80%**: Severe exposure—business model fundamentally threatened
- **80-100%**: Extreme exposure—complete transformation required

**Industry benchmarks (current technology):**

- **Legal services**:
  - Contract review: 70-85%
  - Legal research: 60-75%
  - Document drafting: 50-70%
  - Litigation support: 65-80%

- **Accounting services**:
  - Bookkeeping: 85-95%
  - Tax preparation: 60-75%
  - Audit procedures: 55-70%
  - Advisory services: 25-45%

- **Management consulting**:
  - Market research: 70-85%
  - Data analysis: 60-75%
  - Slide deck creation: 55-70%
  - Strategy development: 30-50%

**Critical insight:** Don't just assess current automation capability. Consider:
- **Technology improvement rate**: Current frontier models improve ~30% annually
- **Sector-specific tool development**: Legal, accounting, and consulting-specific AI tools are developing rapidly
- **Integration with workflows**: What's clunky today becomes seamless within 12-18 months

**Conservative approach:** Assume anything rated 3+ today will be 4+ within 18 months.

### Dimension 2: Revenue Model Exposure

**How dependent is your revenue model on time-based billing?**

AI disruption hurts most when revenue is directly tied to hours worked. When AI reduces 800-hour audits to 300 hours, hourly billing firms face immediate revenue pressure. Firms with value-based, outcome-based, or subscription pricing have more flexibility—but not immunity.

**Assessment questions:**

**Pricing model distribution:**
- What % of revenue is hourly/time-based billing?
- What % is fixed-price project billing?
- What % is value-based or outcome-based?
- What % is subscription or retainer?

**Client switching costs:**
- How easy is it for clients to change providers?
- How transparent is pricing to clients?
- How price-sensitive are your clients?

**Value capture model:**
- Do you charge for inputs (time) or outcomes (results)?
- Can you capture value from AI-driven efficiency?
- Can you serve more clients with same resources?

**Revenue model risk scoring:**

**High risk (7-10 points)**:
- 80%+ hourly billing
- Low client switching costs (commoditized services)
- High price transparency (clients know market rates)
- Value tied directly to time spent

**Medium risk (4-6 points)**:
- 40-80% hourly billing
- Moderate switching costs
- Mixed pricing models
- Some value-based pricing

**Low risk (1-3 points)**:
- <40% hourly billing
- High switching costs (deep client integration)
- Value-based or subscription pricing
- Premium brand positioning

**The revenue cliff problem:**

The most dangerous scenario is the revenue cliff: rapid adoption of AI reduces billable hours dramatically before you've transitioned to alternative pricing models.

**Example**: Law firm generates $10M annually from contract review (1,000 contracts × 20 hours × $500/hour). They adopt AI that reduces time to 5 hours per contract. Before transitioning to value-based pricing:

- **Year 1**: $10M (no AI adoption)
- **Year 2**: $7M (25% adoption, some efficiency leaked to clients as lower bills)
- **Year 3**: $4M (75% adoption, significant efficiency leaked)
- **Year 4**: $6M (100% adoption, but successfully transitioned 40% of clients to value-based pricing)
- **Year 5**: $8M (growing value-based book, serving 2x the clients)

The Years 2-4 revenue cliff is why timing and sequencing matter.

**Strategic implications:**

**If high revenue model risk:**
- Pricing transformation is your highest priority
- Start transitioning new clients immediately
- Create parallel service lines with new pricing
- Accelerate the transition even if short-term revenue suffers

**If medium revenue model risk:**
- Balanced approach—pilot new pricing while maintaining current model
- Segment clients (keep hourly for some, transition others to value-based)
- Build capability to capture value from efficiency

**If low revenue model risk:**
- Leverage AI to expand margins and serve more clients
- Invest efficiency gains in higher-value services
- Use pricing flexibility as competitive advantage

### Dimension 3: Talent Pyramid Exposure

**How dependent is your firm's model on junior staff doing routine work?**

The traditional professional services talent pyramid—many junior staff doing routine work, supervised by mid-level managers, overseen by senior partners—has two functions:

1. **Economic**: Junior staff are profitable (bill at $150-250/hour, cost firm $75-120/hour)
2. **Developmental**: Junior positions train future senior professionals

AI threatens both functions. When AI does routine work, you need fewer juniors (economic pressure) and have no pipeline of trained senior staff (developmental pressure).

**Assessment questions:**

**Current pyramid structure:**
- What's your ratio of junior:mid-level:senior staff?
- What % of revenue comes from junior staff billing?
- What % of junior work could be AI-automated?
- How long does it take to develop a junior into a mid-level professional?

**Training model dependency:**
- Do junior staff learn primarily by doing routine work?
- Is there an alternative training path (rotations, simulations, mentorship)?
- How long could you sustain current partnership track without junior work?

**Economic model:**
- What's the profit margin on junior staff billing?
- Could you maintain profitability with half as many junior staff?
- What happens to utilization if junior work is automated?

**Talent pyramid risk scoring:**

**High risk (7-10 points)**:
- Traditional steep pyramid (5+ juniors per senior partner)
- 40%+ of revenue from junior staff billing
- 80%+ of junior work is automatable
- No alternative training model
- Junior role profitability > 30%

**Medium risk (4-6 points)**:
- Moderate pyramid (2-4 juniors per senior partner)
- 20-40% of revenue from junior staff
- 50-80% of junior work is automatable
- Some alternative training exists
- Junior role profitability 15-30%

**Low risk (1-3 points)**:
- Flat structure (<2 juniors per senior)
- <20% of revenue from junior staff
- Limited automatable junior work
- Strong alternative training models
- Lower junior role margins

**The talent dilemma:**

You face a difficult choice:

**Option A**: Maintain current junior staff levels
- Protects training pipeline
- Maintains culture and career paths
- But: Reduces profitability as AI does work more cheaply
- And: Competitors with leaner staffing will have cost advantage

**Option B**: Aggressively reduce junior staff
- Improves profitability (AI is cheaper than juniors)
- Enables competitive pricing
- But: Breaks training pipeline
- And: Creates future senior staff shortage

**Option C**: Transform junior roles
- Redesign junior work around AI augmentation (AI does execution, junior does oversight/learning)
- Develop new training models (rotations, AI-augmented learning, intensive mentorship)
- Requires significant investment in new training infrastructure
- But: Preserves pipeline while gaining efficiency

Most firms will be forced toward Option C, but few are preparing for it.

**Strategic implications:**

**If high talent pyramid risk:**
- Junior role transformation is urgent
- Begin redesigning roles and training immediately
- Pilot alternative career development paths
- Communicate transparently with junior staff

**If medium talent pyramid risk:**
- Gradual role evolution over 24-36 months
- Selective hiring freeze on junior positions
- Enhanced training investment

**If low talent pyramid risk:**
- Maintain core model with AI augmentation
- Modest role adjustments
- Competitive advantage in talent development

### Dimension 4: Competitive Positioning Exposure

**How vulnerable are you to competitive pressure from AI adoption?**

Even if you successfully adopt AI internally, you face risk if competitors adopt more aggressively or if AI-native startups enter your market. This dimension assesses your relative position.

**Assessment questions:**

**Competitor AI adoption:**
- How many of your top 10 competitors have announced AI initiatives?
- Are any competitors offering AI-augmented services at lower prices?
- Have any competitors transitioned to AI-enabled pricing models?

**Market entry barriers:**
- How hard is it for AI-native startups to enter your market?
- What regulatory barriers exist?
- How strong are your client relationships?
- How specialized is your domain knowledge?

**Differentiation:**
- Do clients choose you for expertise or execution?
- How much of your value is relationship vs. deliverable?
- Can AI replicate your differentiation?

**Competitive time horizon:**
- Are you a first mover, fast follower, or laggard in AI adoption?
- What's the time difference between you and fastest competitor?

**Competitive positioning risk scoring:**

**High risk (7-10 points)**:
- Multiple competitors ahead in AI adoption
- Low market entry barriers
- Commoditized services (clients choose on price)
- Weak client relationships
- Easily replicated expertise
- Laggard in adoption (12+ months behind leaders)

**Medium risk (4-6 points)**:
- Some competitors adopting AI
- Moderate entry barriers
- Differentiated but not unique
- Solid but not sticky client relationships
- Fast follower position (6-12 months behind)

**Low risk (1-3 points)**:
- Leading or matching competitor AI adoption
- High market entry barriers (regulation, specialization)
- Unique positioning or expertise
- Deep, sticky client relationships
- First mover or early adopter

**The competitive dynamics:**

Understanding competitor positioning helps you calibrate your response:

**If you're a first mover:**
- You have 12-24 months to establish AI-augmented positioning
- Risk: betting on immature technology
- Opportunity: market leadership and premium pricing

**If you're a fast follower:**
- You can learn from first mover mistakes
- Risk: losing ground to faster competitors
- Opportunity: adopt proven approaches quickly

**If you're a laggard:**
- You face immediate competitive pressure
- Risk: continuing to fall behind
- Option: Aggressive transformation or exit/consolidation

**Competitive scenarios to consider:**

**Scenario 1**: Competitor offers same services at 40% lower price due to AI efficiency
- How do you respond? Match pricing? Emphasize quality? Lose market share?

**Scenario 2**: AI-native startup enters with 10x cost advantage
- Do you compete? Acquire them? Partner? Focus on different market segment?

**Scenario 3**: Client directly asks why they should pay you when AI can do the work
- How do you articulate your value beyond execution?

**Strategic implications:**

**If high competitive exposure:**
- Accelerate adoption timeline
- Consider aggressive moves (acquire AI-native firm, dramatic pricing changes)
- Strengthen defensible advantages (relationships, specialization)

**If medium competitive exposure:**
- Match pace of fastest competitors
- Selective innovation in high-value areas
- Strengthen client relationships

**If low competitive exposure:**
- Leverage position for premium pricing
- Set industry standards
- Build defensible moats deeper

## The Risk Assessment Scorecard

Combining all four dimensions into a single assessment:

### Scoring Your Firm

For each dimension, use the detailed assessments above to assign scores:

- **Task Automation Exposure**: 1-10 (higher = more exposure)
- **Revenue Model Exposure**: 1-10 (higher = more exposure)
- **Talent Pyramid Exposure**: 1-10 (higher = more exposure)
- **Competitive Positioning Exposure**: 1-10 (higher = more exposure)

**Total Risk Score** = Sum of four dimensions (4-40 points)

**Weighted Risk Score** = Can weight dimensions based on your priorities

### Risk Profile Interpretation

**35-40 points: Critical Risk**
- Multiple dimensions show severe exposure
- Transformation is not optional—it's survival
- Timeline: Need visible progress in 6-12 months
- Strategic approach: Aggressive transformation or exit

**28-34 points: High Risk**
- Significant exposure across multiple dimensions
- Transformation is urgent but you have time to be strategic
- Timeline: Comprehensive plan and execution within 12-18 months
- Strategic approach: Aggressive transformation

**21-27 points: Moderate Risk**
- Exposure is real but manageable
- Transformation is important but can be phased
- Timeline: Solid progress within 18-24 months
- Strategic approach: Gradual transition

**14-20 points: Low-Moderate Risk**
- Limited exposure or longer time horizons
- Transformation is opportunity-focused rather than defensive
- Timeline: Deliberate adoption over 24-36 months
- Strategic approach: Optimize and enhance

**4-13 points: Low Risk**
- Minimal current exposure
- AI is enhancement tool rather than existential threat
- Timeline: Flexible adoption timeline
- Strategic approach: Selective innovation

### Time Horizon Estimation

Beyond total risk score, estimate your time horizon to material impact:

**Factors accelerating disruption:**
- Technology in your sector already mature
- Aggressive competitor AI adoption
- Price-sensitive clients
- Commoditized services

**Factors delaying disruption:**
- Immature technology for your use cases
- High regulatory barriers
- Deep client relationships
- Highly specialized expertise

**Time horizon framework:**

**12-18 months (Immediate):**
- Mature AI tools already available for your services
- Competitors actively deploying AI
- High task automation exposure (60%+)
- Low market entry barriers

**18-30 months (Near-term):**
- AI tools emerging but not yet mature
- Some competitor activity
- Moderate task automation (40-60%)
- Some protective factors

**30-48 months (Medium-term):**
- Technology still developing for your use cases
- Limited competitor pressure
- Moderate-low automation exposure (20-40%)
- Significant protective factors

**48+ months (Long-term):**
- Technology not yet capable of your work
- Minimal competitive pressure
- Low automation exposure (<20%)
- Strong protective factors

**Most professional services firms will fall in the 18-36 month range.** Don't be overly optimistic about having more time.

## Mapping Your Risk Profile

The risk assessment creates a strategic map:

### Example: Mid-Size Law Firm

**Dimension scores:**
- Task Automation: 8/10 (contract review, research highly automatable)
- Revenue Model: 9/10 (90% hourly billing, low switching costs)
- Talent Pyramid: 7/10 (traditional pyramid, 45% revenue from associates)
- Competitive Positioning: 6/10 (some competitors adopting AI, moderate differentiation)

**Total: 30/40 (High Risk)**

**Time horizon: 18-24 months**

**Strategic priorities:**
1. **Highest priority**: Revenue model transformation (score 9, immediate threat)
2. **High priority**: Competitive positioning (score 6, but moving fast)
3. **Important**: Task automation adoption (score 8, but enables other priorities)
4. **Longer-term**: Talent model redesign (score 7, but 24-36 month timeline)

**Action plan:**
- Month 1-3: Pilot value-based pricing on new clients
- Month 1-6: Deploy AI for contract review (high automation task)
- Month 6-12: Transition 25% of client base to value-based pricing
- Month 12-18: Redesign associate roles around AI augmentation
- Month 18-24: Achieve 50% value-based pricing, AI-augmented service delivery

### Example: Boutique Consulting Firm

**Dimension scores:**
- Task Automation: 5/10 (research/analysis automatable, strategy less so)
- Revenue Model: 4/10 (mix of project and retainer, some value-based)
- Talent Pyramid: 3/10 (flat structure, limited junior dependency)
- Competitive Positioning: 5/10 (niche positioning, but AI-native competitors emerging)

**Total: 17/40 (Low-Moderate Risk)**

**Time horizon: 30-42 months**

**Strategic priorities:**
1. **Opportunistic**: Adopt AI for research/analysis efficiency gains
2. **Medium-term**: Evolve pricing to capture value from AI leverage
3. **Monitor**: Competitive dynamics and AI capability development
4. **Advantage**: Use efficiency gains to expand client base

**Action plan:**
- Year 1: Pilot AI tools for research and analysis
- Year 1-2: Develop AI-augmented service offerings
- Year 2-3: Gradual pricing evolution toward value capture
- Ongoing: Maintain competitive positioning through specialization and relationships

## Common Assessment Mistakes

Firms commonly make these errors when assessing AI risk:

### Mistake 1: Optimism Bias

**Pattern**: Focusing on why AI won't work in your specific context rather than objectively assessing capability.

**Examples**:
- "Our clients are complex, not like the examples in articles"
- "Our work requires deep relationships AI can't replicate"
- "We've seen technology hype before"

**Reality check**: Most professional services work is more routine than professionals admit. The 20% of truly bespoke, relationship-intensive work doesn't negate the 80% that's increasingly automatable.

### Mistake 2: Static Assessment

**Pattern**: Assessing AI capability today without accounting for rapid improvement trajectory.

**Examples**:
- "Current AI makes mistakes on complex contracts"
- "AI-generated analysis still needs significant human editing"
- "The technology isn't ready for our standards"

**Reality check**: AI capabilities are improving 20-40% annually. What's inadequate today may be production-ready in 12-18 months. Assess trajectory, not just current state.

### Mistake 3: Isolated Dimension Thinking

**Pattern**: Focusing on one dimension (usually task automation) while ignoring others.

**Examples**:
- "Only 30% of our work is automatable, so we're safe"
- Missing: Revenue model exposure (hourly billing under pressure)
- Missing: Competitive exposure (AI-native firms entering market)

**Reality check**: Risk is multidimensional. Low exposure in one dimension doesn't eliminate high exposure in others.

### Mistake 4: Averaging Across Services

**Pattern**: Assessing the firm as a whole rather than service-line-by-service-line.

**Examples**:
- "Our overall automation exposure is 40%" (averaging 80% contract review and 20% litigation)
- Missing: Contract review generates 60% of revenue and faces immediate threat

**Reality check**: Risk varies dramatically by service line. Assess each major service line separately, then aggregate weighted by strategic importance.

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Competitive Dynamics

**Pattern**: Focusing only on internal capability/efficiency without considering competitive pressure.

**Examples**:
- "We'll adopt AI gradually to maintain quality"
- Missing: Competitor offering same services at 40% lower price with AI
- Missing: AI-native startup entering market

**Reality check**: You don't compete against an absolute standard but against other firms. Relative positioning matters as much as absolute capability.

## Taking Action on Your Assessment

Once you've completed your risk assessment:

**Step 1: Validate with diverse perspectives**
- Don't assess alone—include partners from different practice areas
- Include voices of skeptics (they'll identify blind spots)
- Consider external perspective (advisor, consultant, peer firm)

**Step 2: Communicate to key stakeholders**
- Partners need to understand risk profile honestly
- Board or investors need strategic context
- Key clients may need positioning updates

**Step 3: Map to strategic priorities**
- Your risk profile shapes which strategic decisions matter most
- High revenue model risk → pricing transformation priority
- High competitive risk → speed matters more than perfection
- High talent pyramid risk → workforce strategy is urgent

**Step 4: Establish review cadence**
- Risk profile will shift as technology evolves and competitors move
- Quarterly reviews for high-risk firms
- Semi-annual reviews for moderate-risk firms
- Annual reviews for low-risk firms

**Step 5: Build transformation roadmap**
- Chapter 3 provides strategic options framework
- Chapters 4-9 address specific strategic decisions
- Your risk profile guides which decisions are most urgent

## Key Takeaways

1. **AI risk is multidimensional** across task automation, revenue model, talent pyramid, and competitive positioning. Weakness in any dimension creates vulnerability.

2. **Most professional services firms face 18-36 month time horizons** before AI materially impacts their business. This is shorter than most executives estimate.

3. **Honest assessment is uncomfortable but necessary**. Optimism bias and averaging across service lines create false comfort that delays necessary action.

4. **Risk varies dramatically by service line**. Assess each major service separately, weighted by strategic importance and revenue contribution.

5. **Competitive dynamics matter as much as absolute capability**. You compete against other firms and emerging AI-native alternatives, not against theoretical standards.

6. **Assessment drives strategy**. Your risk profile determines which strategic decisions are most urgent and which strategic archetypes are viable.

7. **Risk profiles shift over time**. What's a 24-month problem today may become a 12-month crisis tomorrow as technology improves and competitors move.

## Reflection Questions

1. Which of the four risk dimensions represents your greatest vulnerability? Which represents your greatest strength?

2. Are you assessing AI capability based on today's technology or trajectory? What will be possible in 18 months that isn't today?

3. How honest are you being about what percentage of your work is truly bespoke versus routine? What would an objective outsider say?

4. What service lines face the highest automation exposure? Do these align with your most profitable or fastest-growing services?

5. How much of your revenue depends on time-based billing? What would happen to revenue if billable hours decreased 50% before you transitioned pricing models?

6. What would happen to your talent pipeline if you needed 50% fewer junior staff? How would you develop future senior professionals?

7. Which competitors are ahead of you in AI adoption? What advantage does that give them? How long before that advantage becomes decisive?

8. What is your realistic time horizon to material business impact? Are you planning and moving with appropriate urgency?
