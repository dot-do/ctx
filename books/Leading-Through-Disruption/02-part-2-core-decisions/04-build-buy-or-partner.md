# Chapter 4: Build, Buy, or Partner

*"The most expensive decision is often choosing to build what you could have bought, or buying what you should have built."*

## Three Firms, Three Choices

Three mid-size law firms, each with about 150 attorneys, all faced the same challenge in early 2023: how to acquire AI capabilities for contract review and legal research.

**Firm A chose to build.** They hired two AI engineers, a data scientist, and invested $2M in developing custom AI tools integrated with their document management system. Timeline: 18 months to production. Rationale: "This is core to our competitive differentiation. We need capabilities tailored to our specific expertise."

**Firm B chose to buy.** They licensed Harvey AI and other commercial legal AI tools for $200K annually. Timeline: deployed in 3 months. Rationale: "Why reinvent the wheel? Professional AI tools exist. Our competitive advantage is legal expertise, not AI development."

**Firm C chose to partner.** They formed a strategic partnership with an AI-native legal tech startup, providing domain expertise and client access in exchange for customized AI capabilities and revenue share. Investment: minimal cash, significant partnership time. Timeline: 6 months to initial deployment. Rationale: "We get technology expertise we lack, they get legal domain knowledge and distribution. Together we're stronger than separately."

Eighteen months later, the results:

**Firm A** had capable AI tools specifically designed for their workflows, but the project ran 6 months late and $800K over budget. Meanwhile, commercial tools had advanced significantly, making some of their custom development obsolete. They had ongoing development and maintenance costs of $600K annually. Their custom tools were impressive but not dramatically better than commercial alternatives.

**Firm B** was fully operational within 3 months, had access to constantly improving commercial tools, and spent their time and money on change management and client development rather than technology development. However, they had limited ability to customize and were dependent on vendor roadmaps. When their primary vendor was acquired and raised prices 40%, they faced disruption.

**Firm C's partnership** moved slower than pure commercial tools but faster than custom development. They had input into product roadmap without bearing full development costs. But the partnership required significant management time, raised questions about data sharing and IP ownership, and created potential conflicts as the startup also partnered with competitor firms.

Which firm made the right choice?

Once again, it depends. Each decision was right or wrong based on the firm's specific strategy, resources, and context.

This chapter provides a framework for making the most critical technology decision: how to acquire AI capabilities.

## Why This Decision Matters

The build-buy-partner decision is perhaps the single highest-impact strategic choice you'll make because:

**Resource implications are enormous.** Building requires millions and years; buying requires thousands and months; partnering requires different but still significant resources.

**Strategic flexibility differs dramatically.** Custom build provides maximum control but minimum flexibility. Commercial tools provide less control but easier switching. Partnerships create interdependencies.

**Speed varies 10x.** Commercial tools can deploy in weeks; custom development takes 12-24+ months; partnerships fall somewhere in between.

**Capability evolution matters.** Commercial tools improve continuously (often monthly); custom tools improve at your pace (often slowly); partnership capabilities depend on partner's investment and priorities.

**Technical debt accumulates differently.** Build creates ongoing maintenance obligations; buy creates vendor dependencies; partner creates relationship management overhead.

Make the wrong choice and you:
- Waste millions on custom development that you could have licensed for thousands
- Become dependent on vendors who raise prices, change direction, or get acquired
- Lock yourself into partnerships that constrain future options
- Fall behind competitors who chose better strategies

Make the right choice and you:
- Acquire capabilities efficiently and effectively
- Maintain appropriate strategic control
- Preserve resources for higher-value activities
- Position yourself for rapid evolution as technology improves

## The Core vs. Context Framework

The fundamental question is: **Is this capability core to your competitive differentiation or is it context that enables your business?**

**Core capabilities** are:
- What clients choose you for
- What creates sustainable competitive advantage
- What you do better than alternatives
- What you must control to succeed

**Context capabilities** are:
- Necessary but not differentiating
- Available from multiple providers
- Better when standardized across industry
- Not worth the cost to customize

**For most professional services firms, AI is context, not core.**

Your core capability is domain expertise—deep understanding of law, accounting, consulting, whatever your specialty. AI is a tool that enables you to deliver that expertise more effectively.

There are exceptions:
- AI-native legal tech startup: AI is core
- Consulting firm building proprietary AI for specific vertical: AI becomes core
- Accounting firm whose differentiation is AI-augmented services: AI integration is core

But for most firms, AI is like cloud infrastructure, office software, or telecommunications—essential context that you should acquire efficiently rather than build from scratch.

**The strategic implication:**

If AI is context (true for 80%+ of professional services firms), you should default to **buy** or **partner** unless there are compelling reasons to build.

If AI is genuinely core to your differentiation, **build** becomes viable, but only if you have the resources and capabilities to build well.

## The Build-Buy-Partner Decision Matrix

Use this framework to decide for each AI capability:

### Decision Factor 1: Strategic Importance

**High strategic importance (differentiating capability):**
- This capability creates competitive advantage
- Clients choose you partially because of this capability
- Unique to your firm or approach
- Worth significant investment

**Medium strategic importance (valuable but not differentiating):**
- Improves your service but doesn't differentiate
- Clients expect this capability but don't choose you for it
- Industry-standard functionality
- Worth moderate investment

**Low strategic importance (commodity capability):**
- Necessary but entirely undifferentiating
- Clients assume you have this
- Pure cost center
- Minimize investment

**Framework:**
- High importance → Consider building (if you have capability)
- Medium importance → Buy or partner
- Low importance → Buy (cheapest viable option)

### Decision Factor 2: Availability of Solutions

**Mature commercial market:**
- Multiple vendors offering capability
- Proven, production-ready solutions
- Regular updates and improvements
- Competitive pricing

**Emerging commercial market:**
- Few vendors, immature solutions
- Solutions exist but have gaps
- Rapid evolution but also churn
- Uncertain pricing and sustainability

**No commercial market:**
- No vendors offering this capability
- Must build or find partner willing to co-develop
- High risk but potential for differentiation

**Framework:**
- Mature market → Strong bias toward buy
- Emerging market → Buy if good enough, partner if gaps are significant
- No market → Build only if truly strategic, partner if possible, consider whether you really need it

### Decision Factor 3: Customization Requirements

**Minimal customization needed:**
- Off-the-shelf solutions work fine
- Standard workflows and processes
- Similar needs to other firms in your space

**Moderate customization needed:**
- Configuration of commercial tools required
- Some workflow adaptation necessary
- Mix of standard and custom processes

**High customization required:**
- Unique workflows or requirements
- Deep integration with proprietary systems
- Highly specialized domain knowledge embedded

**Framework:**
- Minimal customization → Buy
- Moderate customization → Buy with implementation partner or partner for customization
- High customization → Partner (co-develop) or build (if truly strategic)

### Decision Factor 4: Resources and Capabilities

**Strong AI/tech capability:**
- In-house AI/engineering talent
- Experience building software
- Infrastructure and tools
- Budget for development and maintenance

**Moderate tech capability:**
- Some technical staff
- Can implement and integrate tools
- Can manage vendors and partners
- Limited development capability

**Weak tech capability:**
- No in-house technical expertise
- History of technology implementation challenges
- Limited budget for technology investment

**Framework:**
- Strong capability + strategic importance → Build becomes viable
- Moderate capability → Buy or partner
- Weak capability → Buy (simplest commercial solutions)

### Decision Factor 5: Speed Requirements

**Need capability immediately (0-6 months):**
- Competitive pressure
- Client demands
- Market window closing

**Need capability soon (6-18 months):**
- Deliberate transformation timeline
- Can afford to develop thoughtfully
- Learning before scaling

**Can develop over time (18+ months):**
- Long-term strategic play
- Building for future state
- Can invest in capabilities that don't exist yet

**Framework:**
- Immediate need → Buy only (fastest)
- Soon → Buy or partner
- Long-term → Build becomes viable (if strategic)

### Decision Factor 6: Risk Tolerance

**Low risk tolerance:**
- Can't afford failed experiments
- Need proven, reliable solutions
- Stakeholders demand certainty

**Moderate risk tolerance:**
- Can pilot and learn
- Accept some failure as part of learning
- Stakeholders understand transformation risk

**High risk tolerance:**
- Willing to bet on emerging technology
- See strategic value in being first
- Stakeholders support innovation

**Framework:**
- Low risk tolerance → Buy (proven commercial solutions)
- Moderate risk tolerance → Buy or partner
- High risk tolerance → Build or partner becomes viable

## Applying the Framework: Specific Scenarios

Let's apply the framework to common AI capabilities:

### Scenario 1: Contract Review AI (Law Firm)

**Strategic importance**: Medium (valuable efficiency, but expertise is the differentiator)
**Availability**: Mature market (Harvey, Kira, LawGeex, others)
**Customization**: Minimal to moderate (some contract types more specialized)
**Resources**: Most firms have moderate tech capability
**Speed**: Soon (need within 6-12 months for competitive reasons)
**Risk tolerance**: Moderate

**Decision**: **BUY**

Lean toward commercial tools (Harvey, Kira) unless you have highly specialized contract types requiring deep customization, in which case **PARTNER** with vendor for custom training.

Building custom is almost never justified—commercial tools are too good, too mature, and improving too fast.

### Scenario 2: AI-Augmented Audit Automation (Accounting Firm)

**Strategic importance**: High if this is your competitive differentiation, Medium if industry-standard
**Availability**: Emerging market (some commercial tools, but gaps remain)
**Customization**: Moderate to high (specific audit methodologies, client systems)
**Resources**: Big 4 have strong capability, smaller firms moderate
**Speed**: Soon to long-term depending on strategy
**Risk tolerance**: Accounting is typically lower risk tolerance

**Decision**: **BUY** for commodity audit functions (sampling, data extraction) + **PARTNER** for differentiated methodologies

Big 4 accounting firms might **BUILD** components of highly differentiated audit approaches, but even they increasingly buy or partner rather than build from scratch.

### Scenario 3: Industry-Specific AI Tools (Specialized Consulting Firm)

**Strategic importance**: High (core to your differentiation)
**Availability**: No commercial market (too specialized)
**Customization**: High (unique to your methodology)
**Resources**: Varies by firm
**Speed**: Can be longer-term
**Risk tolerance**: Depends on firm culture

**Decision**: **PARTNER** (co-develop with AI firm) or **BUILD** (if you have strong tech capability)

This is one of the few scenarios where build makes sense—if you have capability, resources, and the AI integration is genuinely core to your differentiation.

Even here, partnering is often smarter: find an AI firm that wants to build for your vertical, provide domain expertise and first client, get customized tools without bearing full development cost.

### Scenario 4: Legal Research AI (Law Firm)

**Strategic importance**: Low to medium (necessary but not differentiating)
**Availability**: Mature market (Westlaw AI, Lexis+AI, others)
**Customization**: Minimal (works out of the box)
**Resources**: Any level
**Speed**: Immediate to soon
**Risk tolerance**: Any level

**Decision**: **BUY**

This is the easiest decision. Commercial legal research with AI is mature, competitive, and constantly improving. Buy from established provider (probably already using Westlaw or Lexis). No reason to build or even partner.

## The Partnership Model Deep Dive

Partnerships deserve special attention because they're often the right choice but underutilized.

### Partnership Structure Options

**White-label partnership:**
- AI firm builds technology
- Your firm brands and sells it
- Revenue share or license agreement
- Example: Law firm white-labels legal AI, sells to clients as "Firm Name Legal AI"

**Co-development partnership:**
- Joint development of new capabilities
- Shared IP or licensing rights
- Both parties invest resources (cash + expertise)
- Example: Consulting firm + AI startup build industry-specific analysis tools

**Distribution partnership:**
- AI firm provides technology
- Your firm provides clients and domain expertise
- Revenue share on sales
- Example: Accounting firm recommends and integrates partner's AI bookkeeping, receives revenue share

**Strategic investment + partnership:**
- Your firm invests in AI startup
- Gets preferred pricing, product input, equity upside
- Partner gets capital and customer
- Example: Law firm invests $500K in legal tech startup, gets board seat and product influence

### Partnership Success Factors

**Clear value exchange:**
- What does each party provide?
- What does each party get?
- Is the exchange balanced?

**Aligned incentives:**
- Do both parties win if the partnership succeeds?
- Are there potential conflicts of interest?
- How are disagreements resolved?

**Defined IP and data ownership:**
- Who owns technology developed?
- Who owns client data?
- Can partner use your data to improve product for competitors?

**Governance and decision rights:**
- How are product priorities decided?
- Who has final say on what?
- How often do you review partnership?

**Exit provisions:**
- What happens if partnership doesn't work?
- Can you terminate? On what terms?
- What happens to your investment and customizations?

### Partnership Risks and Mitigation

**Risk: Partner gets acquired or changes strategy**

Mitigation:
- Contract provisions for acquisition scenarios
- Data portability requirements
- Alternative vendor relationships maintained

**Risk: Partner works with your competitors**

Mitigation:
- Exclusivity provisions (expensive and hard to negotiate)
- Firewall requirements for your data and customizations
- Accept that non-exclusive partnerships mean some competitor access

**Risk: Partner fails or struggles financially**

Mitigation:
- Due diligence on partner's financial health
- Escrow for source code
- Don't bet everything on one partner

**Risk: Partnership management takes more time than expected**

Mitigation:
- Dedicated partnership manager on your side
- Clear meeting cadence and communication protocols
- Quarterly partnership reviews

## The Build Option: When and How

Building is the highest-risk, highest-cost option. Only pursue it when:

1. **Capability is core to your differentiation** (not just valuable, but differentiating)
2. **No commercial or partnership options exist** that meet your needs
3. **You have genuine technical capability** (not just willingness to hire it)
4. **You have budget and timeline flexibility** (12-24 months minimum)
5. **You can commit to ongoing maintenance and evolution** (not just initial build)

### Build Requirements

If you decide to build, you need:

**Technical team:**
- ML engineers (2-5 depending on scope)
- Data engineers (1-3)
- Software engineers (2-4)
- Product manager
- DevOps/infrastructure engineer
- Total cost: $1M-$3M annually for minimal team

**Infrastructure:**
- Cloud computing resources
- LLM API access (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Development and production environments
- Monitoring and security tools
- Cost: $200K-$500K annually

**Data:**
- Training data (your own or licensed)
- Annotation/labeling if needed
- Data infrastructure for storage and processing
- Cost: Highly variable, $50K-$500K+

**Time:**
- Minimum 12 months to production
- Realistically 18-24 months for complex capabilities
- Ongoing development forever

**Total minimum investment:**
- **Year 1**: $2M-$5M (team + infrastructure + data + tools)
- **Ongoing**: $1.5M-$4M annually (team + infrastructure + evolution)

**This is why most firms should not build.**

### Build-Trap Avoidance

If you do build, avoid common traps:

**Trap 1: Underestimating complexity**

Building AI that works in demos is 10x easier than building AI that works in production with real clients, real data, and real liability.

**Trap 2: Ongoing costs**

Initial development is just the beginning. AI models need continuous improvement, infrastructure needs maintenance, team needs retention. Ongoing costs often exceed initial development.

**Trap 3: Falling behind**

While you spend 18 months building, commercial tools improve dramatically. Your custom tool may be obsolete before production.

**Trap 4: Lack of focus**

AI development diverts leadership attention and resources from your core business. Unless AI is your core business, this is value-destructive.

**Trap 5: Talent challenges**

AI talent is expensive, in high demand, and often prefers product companies over service firms. Recruiting and retaining AI team is harder than you think.

## The Buy Option: Maximizing Value

Buying commercial tools is the right answer 80% of the time. How to do it well:

### Vendor Selection Criteria

**Capability fit:**
- Does the tool do what you need?
- How well does it work for your use cases?
- What's the accuracy/quality level?

**Integration:**
- Does it work with your existing systems?
- How much implementation effort required?
- APIs and data exchange capabilities?

**Vendor strength:**
- Financial stability
- Customer base and references
- Product roadmap and development velocity
- Support and service quality

**Pricing:**
- Total cost of ownership (licenses + implementation + training + support)
- Pricing model (per user, per transaction, flat fee)
- Price trajectory (will costs increase significantly?)

**Data and security:**
- How is your data handled?
- Security and compliance certifications
- Data residency and sovereignty
- Can you delete your data?

**Flexibility:**
- Can you customize or configure?
- Can you switch vendors if needed?
- Contract terms and lock-in

### Multi-Vendor Strategy

Don't put all eggs in one basket. Most firms should:

**Primary vendors** for core capabilities (legal research, document review):
- Choose strong, established vendors
- Accept some lock-in for reliability

**Secondary vendors** for specialized capabilities:
- More flexibility to switch
- Pilot multiple options

**Maintain optionality:**
- Avoid exclusive long-term contracts when possible
- Design workflows that aren't tightly coupled to single vendor
- Track emerging alternatives

**Expect vendor churn:**
- Vendors will be acquired
- Pricing and terms will change
- Product direction will shift
- Build processes to handle vendor transitions

## Decision Framework Summary

Use this flowchart for any AI capability:

```
1. Is this capability core to our competitive differentiation?
   - No → Strong bias toward BUY
   - Yes → Continue to 2

2. Do mature commercial solutions exist?
   - Yes → Strong bias toward BUY (unless very high customization needs)
   - No → Continue to 3

3. Do we have strong technical capability and resources?
   - No → PARTNER or BUY (simplest available option)
   - Yes → Continue to 4

4. Can we wait 18-24 months for custom development?
   - No → PARTNER or BUY
   - Yes → BUILD becomes viable (but still consider PARTNER)

5. Can we commit to ongoing development and maintenance?
   - No → Do not BUILD
   - Yes → BUILD or PARTNER based on cost-benefit

Default recommendation for most firms: BUY for commodity capabilities, PARTNER for strategic customization
```

## Common Decision Scenarios by Firm Type

### Law Firms

**BUY:**
- Legal research AI (Westlaw AI, Lexis+)
- Standard contract review (Harvey, Kira)
- Document automation (tools exist)
- Practice management with AI features

**PARTNER:**
- Highly specialized contract types
- Custom legal workflows
- Client-specific integrations

**BUILD:**
- Rarely justified unless AI is your business model

### Accounting Firms

**BUY:**
- Bookkeeping automation (QuickBooks AI, Pilot, others)
- Tax research and preparation assists
- Standard audit sampling and testing

**PARTNER:**
- Custom audit methodologies
- Client-specific integrations
- Industry vertical specialization

**BUILD:**
- Only Big 4 should consider, and only for highly differentiated audit approaches

### Consulting Firms

**BUY:**
- Market research tools
- Data analysis and visualization
- Presentation generation
- Project management with AI

**PARTNER:**
- Industry-specific analysis tools
- Custom methodologies
- Client-specific applications

**BUILD:**
- Only if AI tools become your product (selling AI-enabled consulting)

## Timeline Considerations

Your strategic archetype (Chapter 3) affects build-buy-partner decisions:

**Aggressive Transformation:**
- Bias toward BUY (fastest)
- PARTNER only if critical capabilities don't exist commercially
- BUILD only if absolutely strategic and you have strong in-house capability

**Gradual Transition:**
- BUY for proven capabilities
- PARTNER to customize or extend
- Pilot before scaling
- BUILD is rarely appropriate

**Defend & Optimize:**
- BUY simplest, most mature tools
- No BUILD
- PARTNER only for very specific needs

**Hybrid Model:**
- BUY for commodity tier
- PARTNER for premium customization
- BUILD only if premium tier is about proprietary AI

## Key Takeaways

1. **Default to buy or partner for most firms.** Unless AI is core to your competitive differentiation and you have strong technical capability, building is not justified.

2. **Core vs. context determines the decision.** Context capabilities should be bought. Core capabilities might justify building, but often partnering is smarter.

3. **Commercial AI tools are better than you think.** For most use cases, commercial legal, accounting, and consulting AI tools are surprisingly capable. Test before assuming you need custom.

4. **Partnerships are underutilized.** Many firms overlook partnership models that provide customization without full development cost.

5. **Building is expensive and risky.** Real cost is $2M-$5M initial plus $1.5M-$4M annually ongoing. Most firms dramatically underestimate this.

6. **Vendor relationships will evolve.** Expect vendors to be acquired, change pricing, shift product direction. Build flexibility into your architecture and contracts.

7. **Speed matters more than perfection.** For most firms, deploying good commercial tools quickly beats deploying perfect custom tools slowly.

8. **The decision varies by capability.** You might buy legal research, partner for contract review customization, and build (rarely) for something truly unique. Don't apply same decision to all capabilities.

## Reflection Questions

1. For each major AI capability you need, is it core to your differentiation or context?

2. What technical capabilities do you actually have in-house? Can you realistically build and maintain AI systems?

3. Which vendors are strongest in your sector? Have you thoroughly tested commercial tools before assuming you need custom?

4. What partnerships could give you customized capabilities without full build cost?

5. If you're considering building, what's your honest assessment of:
   - Total cost (including ongoing)?
   - Timeline to production-ready?
   - Competitive risk of commercial tools improving faster?
   - Opportunity cost of diverted resources?

6. Do your build-buy-partner decisions align with your strategic archetype?

7. What's your vendor strategy for managing risk of acquisition, price changes, or direction shifts?
