## Design Principles

### 1. Timeless Over Timely

**Avoid:**
- Specific model names (GPT-4, Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5)
- Version numbers
- Vendor-specific features (except SDK.do in Books 7-10)
- Pricing that will change
- "Latest" or "cutting-edge" language

**Instead Use:**
- "Foundation models" not "GPT-4"
- "Vector databases" not "Pinecone"
- "Agent frameworks" not "LangChain"
- Patterns and principles that transcend specific tools
- Examples that illustrate concepts, not showcase products

**Exception**: Books 7-10 may reference SDK.do platform specifically as the implementation vehicle.

### 2. Progressive Disclosure

Each phase builds on the previous:
- **Phase 1** establishes "what" and "why"
- **Phase 2** applies to "who" (specific personas)
- **Phase 3** teaches "how" (implementation)

Within each book:
- Start accessible, get more detailed
- Concepts before tactics
- Principles before tools

### 3. Standalone but Interconnected

Each book should:
- Work as standalone reading
- Reference other books for deeper dives
- Avoid redundancy while maintaining coherence
- Use consistent terminology and thesis

### 4. Data-Driven but Not Data-Dated

- Use percentage improvements, not absolute numbers
- "10x faster" not "$0.03 per request"
- Cite studies by findings, not by date
- Focus on magnitudes and patterns

### 5. Persona-Appropriate Depth

- **Books 3-4**: Strategic and personal, less technical
- **Books 5-6**: Business mechanics, some technical
- **Books 7-8**: Practical implementation, accessible
- **Books 9-10**: Deep technical, architectural
