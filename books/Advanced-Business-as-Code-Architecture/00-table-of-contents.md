**Subtitle**: System Design and Agent Orchestration in the Age of AI

## Table of Contents

### Part I: The Paradigm Shift

Understanding how software development is fundamentally changing from writing code to orchestrating intelligent systems.

#### Chapter 1: From Code to Orchestration
**Summary**: Explores the fundamental transformation of software development as foundation models and AI agents reshape what it means to be a developer. Examines the shift from writing code line-by-line to designing and orchestrating intelligent agent systems. Uses GitHub Copilot data showing 55% of code now AI-generated as a starting point, then projects forward to a world where developers design agent architectures rather than implement algorithms.

**Key Takeaways**:
- Software development is transitioning from implementation to orchestration
- Foundation models make business logic programmable without traditional coding
- The developer role evolves: less coding, more architecture and system design
- This represents opportunity for 10x leverage, not obsolescence
- New stack: Foundation models + vector databases + agent frameworks + orchestration platforms

#### Chapter 2: Why This Disrupts Traditional Development
**Summary**: Analyzes why this shift is different from previous technology transitions. Examines what traditional development patterns (MVC, microservices, REST APIs) assumed about control flow, determinism, and debugging—and why those assumptions break with AI agents. Explores the economics: why businesses will choose agent orchestration over hand-coded solutions, and what this means for traditional software engineering roles.

**Key Takeaways**:
- AI agents violate core assumptions of traditional software patterns
