## Core Thesis

**If Infrastructure-as-Code enabled Software-as-a-Service in the Cloud era, then Business-as-Code will enable Services-as-Software in the Agentic AI era.**

### The Progression

1. **Infrastructure-as-Code** (2006-2015)
   - Made infrastructure declarative, reproducible, scalable
   - Enabled SaaS by making deployment near-zero cost
   - AWS became the platform of record

2. **Business-as-Code** (2025-2030)
   - Makes business logic declarative, reproducible, scalable
   - Enables Services-as-Software by making service delivery near-zero cost
   - **`.do` can become the platform of record**

3. **Recursive Service Generation** (2025+)
   - Makes service *discovery* systematic and automated
   - AI explores entire possibility space (67.5B services)
   - Platform that does this first defines the category

### The Opportunity

**Traditional Service Creation:**
- Timeline: 1-3 years per service
- Cost: $500k-$5M per service
- Output: 1-5 services per company
- Success rate: 10-20%

**Recursive Service Generation:**
- Timeline: 1-7 days per service
- Cost: $100-$1,000 per service
- Output: 100-1,000 services per company
- Success rate: 1-10% (but 1000x more attempts)

**Net Result:** 50x more successful services at 1/1000th the cost
