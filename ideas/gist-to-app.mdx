# Deploy App from Gist

We could deploy an app entirely from a gist using MDXLD abstractions!

## Concept

GitHub Gists provide a simple way to share code snippets and small projects. By combining Gists with MDXLD (MDX Linked Data) abstractions, we can create a powerful deployment pipeline:

1. **Create a Gist** with MDX files defining the app structure
2. **MDXLD parses** the Gist and extracts entity definitions
3. **Automatic deployment** to Cloudflare Workers/Pages
4. **Live app** running from the Gist source

## Benefits

- **Zero infrastructure setup** - Just create a Gist
- **Version control** - Gists have built-in versioning
- **Shareable** - Easy to fork and modify
- **Rapid prototyping** - From idea to deployed app in minutes

## Implementation

### Step 1: Gist Structure
```
my-app.gist/
├── app.mdx          # Main app definition
├── api.mdx          # API routes
├── components.mdx   # UI components
└── schema.mdx       # Data schema
```

### Step 2: MDXLD Processing
- Parse MDX files
- Extract entity definitions
- Generate deployable artifacts

### Step 3: Deployment
- Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
- Configure routes and bindings
- Serve the app

## Use Cases

- **Quick demos** - Deploy a demo app in seconds
- **Code examples** - Executable documentation
- **Prototypes** - Rapid iteration on ideas
- **Teaching** - Interactive tutorials

## Status

**Current**: Concept
**Priority**: High
**Next Steps**: Build proof-of-concept with simple app
