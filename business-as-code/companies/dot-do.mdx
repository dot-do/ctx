# Dot Do Holdings

AI-native holding company building the infrastructure for autonomous business operations.

## Strategy

### 2025 Objectives

**O1**: Establish API.Services as definitive platform for discoverable, composable functions

- **KR1.1**: 1,000+ functions catalogued and executable via MCP/RPC
- **KR1.2**: 100% test coverage, zero type errors across all repositories
- **KR1.3**: 10+ SDKs published to npm with 95%+ type safety

**O2**: Launch Services.Delivery marketplace generating revenue

- **KR2.1**: 200+ services listed, 100+ actively processing transactions
- **KR2.2**: $500K+ GMV with 15-20% take rate
- **KR2.3**: 100+ verified service providers
- **KR2.4**: 4.5+ average rating, <5% dispute rate

**O3**: Ship Services.Studio enabling creators to "Vibe-Code" agentic AI services

- **KR3.1**: Enable natural language â†’ Function/Workflow generation (80%+ success)
- **KR3.2**: 100+ human-in-the-loop function configurations
- **KR3.3**: 50+ creators publishing profitable services
- **KR3.4**: Top 10 creators generating $5K+ monthly each

**Target: $1M ARR by December 2025**

### OKRs as Ground Truth for RL

These objectives provide **natural reward signals** from real business outcomes, not contrived evals:

**Why Real Outcomes > Synthetic Tests:**
- âœ… $1M ARR = Economic value created (not test coverage %)
- âœ… 200+ services = Market validation (not unit test scores)
- âœ… 4.5+ rating = Customer satisfaction (not synthetic benchmarks)
- âœ… 100+ providers = Network effects (not mock data performance)

**Evaluation Framework:**
```typescript
{
  basis: 'okr-achievement',  // NOT 'contrived-evals'
  groundTruth: 'business-kpis',
  metrics: [
    { objective: 'O1', weight: 0.3, threshold: 0.7 },
    { objective: 'O2', weight: 0.5, threshold: 0.7 },  // Revenue weighted highest
    { objective: 'O3', weight: 0.2, threshold: 0.6 }
  ],
  rewardFunction: {
    type: 'weighted-sum',
    formula: '(0.3 * O1) + (0.5 * O2) + (0.2 * O3)'
  },
  frequency: 'daily'
}
```

**Reward Signals Generated:**

When KRs update, agents receive RL feedback:
```typescript
// Example: GMV increases from $300K â†’ $400K
{
  source: 'kr-update',
  keyResult: 'KR2.2',
  strength: +0.20,  // 20% progress toward $500K target
  economicValue: $100K,  // Real revenue increase
  agents: ['marketplace-agent', 'sales-agent'],
  feedback: "GMV growth accelerating - marketplace gaining traction",
  improvements: ["Provider onboarding automation working"]
}
```

**Learning Loops:**

Continuous improvement from real outcomes:
- **O1 (API.Services)**: SDK downloads, function executions, developer feedback
- **O2 (Services.Delivery)**: GMV, ratings, provider growth, dispute resolution time
- **O3 (Services.Studio)**: Creator signups, service publish rate, revenue per creator

Agents optimize for business success, not test scores.

**Detailed OKR Tracking:**

See standalone OKR files for comprehensive reward signals, evaluation, and learning loops:
