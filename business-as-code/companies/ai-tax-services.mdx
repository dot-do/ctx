## 2025 Objectives & Key Results

- Current: 0 (pre-season)

- Status: Draft

**KR1.4**: Keep error rate <0.5%
- Baseline: Unknown
- Current: N/A
- Target: <0.5%
- Status: Draft

### OKRs as Ground Truth for RL

These objectives provide **real business validation**, not synthetic benchmarks:

**Why Real Outcomes > Contrived Evals:**
- ✅ $990K revenue = Economic value created (not test scores)
- ✅ 10,000 returns = Real customers served (not mock data)
- ✅ 95% CSAT = Actual user satisfaction (not synthetic NPS)
- ✅ <0.5% errors = IRS-validated accuracy (not unit tests)

**Evaluation Framework:**
```typescript
{
  basis: 'okr-achievement',  // NOT 'contrived-evals'
  groundTruth: 'business-kpis',
  metrics: [
    { keyResult: 'KR1.1', weight: 0.25, threshold: 0.7 },  // Volume
    { keyResult: 'KR1.2', weight: 0.35, threshold: 0.7 },  // Revenue (highest weight)
    { keyResult: 'KR1.3', weight: 0.25, threshold: 0.85 }, // Quality
    { keyResult: 'KR1.4', weight: 0.15, threshold: 0.99 }  // Accuracy
  ],
  rewardFunction: {
    type: 'weighted-sum',
    formula: '(0.25 * returns) + (0.35 * revenue) + (0.25 * csat) + (0.15 * accuracy)'
  },
  frequency: 'daily'  // During tax season
}
```

**Reward Signals:**

Real-time feedback from business outcomes:
```typescript
// Example: First 1,000 returns filed
{
  source: 'kr-update',
  keyResult: 'KR1.1',
  strength: +0.10,  // 10% progress toward target
  economicValue: 99000,  // ~$99K revenue
  agents: ['tax-prep.do', 'tax-review.do'],
  feedback: "Filing velocity strong - automation working",
  improvements: [
    "Deduction optimizer finding avg $850 more per return",
    "Review process cleared 98% of returns without escalation"
  ]
}

// Example: Customer satisfaction scores arriving
{
  source: 'kr-update',
  keyResult: 'KR1.3',
  strength: +0.24,  // 96% CSAT (above target)
  agents: ['tax-prep.do', 'support.do'],
  feedback: "Customers love fast turnaround and clear explanations",
  improvements: [
    "AI explanations rated 'very helpful' by 92%",
    "24-hour turnaround time exceeding expectations"
  ]
}
```

**Learning Loops:**

Continuous improvement from tax season outcomes:
- **Returns Volume**: Track conversion rate, drop-off points, pricing sensitivity
- **Revenue**: Analyze which services drive highest revenue, upsell success
- **CSAT**: Correlate satisfaction with turnaround time, accuracy, communication
